There is no effective treatment for AD currently, but the early diagnosis might be beneficial for delaying the disease progression. Apart from invasive laboratory tests and expensive neuroimaging examination, the electroencephalography (EEG) and event related potentials (ERPs) have emerged as promising approaches for the early detection of AD as well as mild cognitive impairment (MCI), due to its affordability, noninvasively, and superior temporal resolution. In addition, the recent advent of deep learning architectures further improves the accuracy of AD and MCI diagnosis.

Further evidence indicates that LPSs up-regulate pro-inflammatory transcription factor complex NF-kB (p50/p65) and subsequently a set of NF-kB-sensitive microRNAs, including miRNA-30b, miRNA-34a, miRNA-146a and miRNA-155. These up-regulated miRNAs in turn down-regulate a family of neurodegeneration-associated messenger RNA (mRNA) targets, including the mRNA encoding the neuron-specific neurofilament light (NF-L) chain protein. While NF-L has been reported to be up-regulated in peripheral biofluids in AD and other progressive and lethal pro-inflammatory neurodegenerative disorders, NF-L is significantly down-regulated within neocortical neurons, and this may account for neuronal atrophy, loss of axonal caliber and alterations in neuronal cell shape, modified synaptic architecture and network deficits in neuronal signaling capacity. This paper reviews and reveals the most current findings on the neurotoxic aspects of LPSs and how these pro-inflammatory glycolipids contribute to the biological mechanism of progressive, age-related and ultimately lethal neurodegenerative disorders.

Additionally, clinical metadata and cerebrospinal fluid AD biomarkers were collected and used for analysis. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) HDL-4 subfraction levels were mostly high in female individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), followed by AD. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) LDL-2 cholesterol was slightly elevated in male AD patients. HDL-2 apolipoprotein Apo-A1, HDL-2 phospholipids, and HDL-3 triglycerides were highly abundant in AD and MCI women compared to men. When considering clinical biomarkers (A\u03b2, tau), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) VLDL-1 and intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL) triglycerides were substantially higher in AD compared to MCI. In addition, triglyceride levels correlated positively with dementia. Different lipoprotein serum patterns were identified for AD, MCI, and control subjects. Interestingly, HDL-4 and LDL-2 cholesterol parameters revealed strong gender-specific changes in the context of AD-driven dementia. As gender-based comparisons were based on smaller sub-groups with a low n-number, several statistical findings did not meet the significance threshold for multiple comparisons testing. Still, our finding suggests that serum HDL-4 parameters and various triglycerides correlate positively with AD pathology which could be a read-out of extended lipids traveling through the blood-brain barrier, supporting amyloid plaque formation processes.

To advance our knowledge about the role of GIIA in AD, we studied the effect of rat GIIA on the neuronal mitochondria and compared it with that of the Atx. We produced recombinant rat GIIA (rGIIA) and its enzymatically inactive mutant, rGIIA(D49S), and demonstrated that they interact with the subunit II of cytochrome c oxidase (CCOX-II) as Atx. rGIIA and rGIIA(D49S) bound to this essential constituent of the respiratory chain complex with an approximately 100-fold lower affinity than Atx; nevertheless, both rGIIA molecules potently inhibited the CCOX activity in the isolated rat mitochondria. Like Atx, rGIIA was able to reach the mitochondria in the PC12 cells from the extracellular space, independent of its enzymatic activity. Consistently, the inhibition of the CCOX activity in the intact PC12 cells and in the rat's brain tissue sections was clearly demonstrated using rGIIA(D49S). Our results show that the effects of mammalian and snake venom \u03b2-neurotoxic GIIA on the neuronal mitochondria have similar molecular backgrounds. They suggest that the elevated extracellular concentration of GIIA in the AD tissue drives the translocation of this enzyme into local neurons and their mitochondria to inhibit the activity of the CCOX in the respiratory chain.

Nevertheless, a number of recent studies have established that E2F4 can also play a relevant role in cell and tissue homeostasis, as well as tissue regeneration. For these non-canonical functions, E2F4 can also act in the cytoplasm, where it is able to interact with many homeostatic and synaptic regulators. Since E2F4 is expressed in the nervous system, it may fulfill a crucial role in brain function and homeostasis, being a promising multifactorial target for neurodegenerative diseases and brain aging. The regulation of E2F4 is complex, as it can be chemically modified through acetylation, from which we present evidence in the brain, as well as methylation, and phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of E2F4 within a conserved threonine motif induces cell cycle re-entry in neurons, while a dominant negative form of E2F4 (E2F4DN), in which the conserved threonines have been substituted by alanines, has been shown to act as a multifactorial therapeutic agent for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We generated transgenic mice neuronally expressing E2F4DN. We have recently shown using this mouse strain that expression of E2F4DN in 5xFAD mice, a known murine model of AD, improved cognitive function, reduced neuronal tetraploidization, and induced a transcriptional program consistent with modulation of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptide proteostasis and brain homeostasis recovery. 5xFAD/E2F4DN mice also showed reduced microgliosis and astrogliosis in both the cerebral cortex and hippocampus at 3-6 months of age.

Its deregulation is associated with many pathological conditions, including neurodegenerative disease, frequently downregulated. The lack of efficient treatment for these diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), makes Wnt signaling an attractive target for therapies. Interestingly, novel Wnt signaling activating compounds are less frequently described than inhibitors, turning the quest for novel positive modulators even more appealing. In that sense, natural compounds are an outstanding source of potential drug leads. Here, we combine different experimental models, cell-based approaches, neuronal culture assays, and rodent behavior tests with <i>Xenopus laevis</i> phenotypic analysis to characterize quercitrin, a natural compound, as a novel Wnt signaling potentiator. We find that quercitrin potentiates the signaling in a concentration-dependent manner and increases the occurrence of the <i>Xenopus</i> secondary axis phenotype mediated by <i>Xwnt8</i> injection. Using a GSK3 biosensor, we describe that quercitrin impairs GSK3 activity and increases phosphorylated GSK3\u03b2 S9 levels. Treatment with XAV939, an inhibitor downstream of GSK3, impairs the quercitrin-mediated effect. Next, we show that quercitrin potentiates the Wnt3a-synaptogenic effect in hippocampal neurons in culture, which is blocked by XAV939. Quercitrin treatment also rescues the hippocampal synapse loss induced by intracerebroventricular injection of amyloid-\u03b2 oligomers (A\u03b2O) in mice.

We addressed this question by immunostaining and electrophysiology at synapses between mossy fibers and CA3 pyramidal cells, in which KARs are abundant and play a prominent physiological role. We observed a decrease of the immunostaining for GluK2 in the stratum lucidum in CA3, and of the amplitude and decay time of synaptic currents mediated by GluK2-containing KARs in an amyloid mouse model (male and female APP/PS1 mice) of AD.

To address these questions, we investigated microstructural alterations of two major cholinergic pathways in individuals along the AD continuum using an in vivo model of the human cholinergic system based on neuroimaging. We included 405 participants (53 AD, 66 MCI, 174 SCD, and 112 healthy controls) from the Deutsches Zentrum f\u00fcr Neurodegenerative Erkrankungen (DZNE) Longitudinal Cognitive Impairment and Dementia Study (DELCODE). We modelled the cholinergic white matter pathways with an enhanced diffusion neuroimaging pipeline that included probabilistic fiber-tracking methods and prior anatomical knowledge. The integrity of the cholinergic white matter pathways was compared between stages of the AD continuum, in the whole cohort and in a CSF amyloid-beta stratified subsample. The discriminative power of the integrity of the pathways was compared to the conventional volumetric measures of hippocampus and nucleus basalis of Meynert, using a receiver operating characteristics analysis. A multivariate model was employed to investigate the role of these pathways in relation to cognitive performance. We found that the integrity of the cholinergic white matter pathways was significantly reduced in all stages of the AD continuum, including individuals with SCD. The differences involved posterior cholinergic white matter in the SCD stage and extended to anterior frontal white matter in MCI and AD dementia stages. Both cholinergic pathways and conventional volumetric measures showed higher predictive power in the more advanced stages of the disease, i.e., MCI and AD dementia. In contrast, the integrity of cholinergic pathways was more informative in distinguishing SCD from healthy controls, as compared with the volumetric measures. The multivariate model revealed a moderate contribution of the cholinergic white matter pathways but not of volumetric measures towards memory tests in the SCD and MCI stages. In conclusion, we demonstrated that cholinergic white matter pathways are altered already in SCD individuals, preceding the more widespread alterations found in MCI and AD.

This study included cognitively intact participants aged 60 to 90 years at baseline with annual follow-up from October 1997 to December 2020 (maximum follow-up of 22 years). During the follow-up, participants underwent brain autopsies. Data were analyzed from August 2021 to February 2022 using mixed-effect models. BMI was calculated using height and weight measured at baseline and follow-ups. Incident MCI and dementia were diagnosed following standard criteria. Neuropathological assessments (including global Alzheimer disease and vascular pathology) were performed for autopsies. A total of 1390 participants (mean [SD] age, 78.4 [6.5] years; 1063 female [76.5%]) were included in the study. In the analysis of BMI trajectories before MCI (n = 939), during the follow-up (median [IQR] duration, 6 [3-9] years), 371 participants (39.5%) developed MCI, of whom 88 (23.7%) progressed to dementia.

However, cellular senescence is characterized by additional changes, such as an irregular cell cycle arrest, and a variety of metabolic and molecular changes including a senescence-associated secretory phenotype, dysfunction of degradation mechanisms, and altered DNA damage response. Here, we tested whether dystrophic microglia display customary markers of cell senescence by performing double and triple staining in sections of the temporal lobe and brain stem from 14 humans. We found that markers related to oxidative damage, such as upregulation of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1), and y-H2AX, as well as inclusion of lipofuscin, do not or only exceptionally colocalize with dystrophic microglia. Further, we did not observe a decline in lamin B1 around nuclear laminae in either dystrophic or ramified microglia within the same microscopic field. Only ferritin expression, which is known to increase with aging in CNS microglia, was frequently observed in dystrophic, but rarely in ramified microglial cells. We conclude that neither dystrophic nor ramified microglia in human brain exhibit significant expression of conventional senescence markers associated with oxidative stress, and that ferritin is the dominant immunophenotypic change related to microglial aging.

We failed to find evidence surpassing correction for multiple comparisons of relationships between genetically proxied PCSK9 inhibition and the risk for the 12 neuropsychiatric end points in either men or women. Drug-target analyses were generally well-powered to detect effect estimates at several hypothesized thresholds for both combined-sex and sex-specific end points, especially analyses using PCSK9 instruments derived from protein and expression quantitative trait loci.

To date, the effects of Abeta42 accumulation on GABAergic synapses are poorly understood Our findings suggest that, similarly to what observed on glutamatergic synapses, Abeta42 modifies GABAergic synapses by targeting ryanodine receptors and causing calcium dysregulation The GABAergic impairments can be restored by the RyR-calstabin interaction stabilizer S107 Based on our research, RyRs stabilization may represent a novel pharmaceutical strategy for preventing or delaying of AD. Oligomeric form of amyloid beta protein Abeta42 contributes to the development of synaptic abnormalities and cognitive impairments associated with AD. To date, there is a gap in knowledge regarding how Abeta42 alters the elementary parameters of GABAergic synaptic function. Here we found that Abeta42 increased the frequency and amplitude of miniature GABAergic currents as well as the amplitude of evoked inhibitory post synaptic currents (eIPSCs). When we focused on paired pulse depression (PPD) to establish whether GABA release probability (p) was affected by Abeta42, we did not observe any significant change. On the other hand, a more detailed investigation of the presynaptic effects induced by Abeta42 by means of multiple probability fluctuation analysis (MPFA) and cumulative amplitude analysis shown an increased size of both the readily releasable pool responsible for synchronous release (RRP<sub>syn</sub> ) and the number of release sites (N). We further explored whether ryanodine receptors (RyRs) contributed to exacerbate these changes by stabilizing the interaction between RyRs and the accessory protein calstabin. We observed that the RyRs calstabin interaction stabilizer S107 restored the synaptic parameters to values comparable to those measured in control conditions. In conclusion, our results clarify the mechanisms of potentiation of GABAergic synapses induced by Abeta42. We further suggest that RyRs are involved in the control of synaptic activity during the early stage of AD onset and that their stabilization could represent a new therapeutical approach for AD treatment. Abstract figure legend Left: pre- and postsynaptic neurons are represented under physiological conditions. At rest, ER membrane contains RyRs in closed state and the ratio between the size of RRP synchronous and asynchronous is shifted towards the asynchronous. Middle: Abeta42 causes calcium dysregulation by targeting RyRs which assume a leaky conformation. Abeta42 potentiates the synchronous release and increases the ratio between the size of RRP synchronous and asynchronous, leaving unaltered the size of RRP total. The number of release sites and the number of GABAergic receptors at the postsynaptic membrane are both increased by Abeta42. Right: S107, a RyCal compound, counteracts the effects induced by Abeta42 on GABAergic synapses by stabilizing RyRs in a close conformational configuration, recovering the size of RRP asynchronous and decreasing the number of release sites.

Many factors affect the onset and development of AD, but specific mechanisms underlying the disease are unclear. Most studies investigating AD have focused on neurons and the gray matter in the central nervous system (CNS) but have not led to effective treatments. Recently, an increasing number of studies have focused on the white matter (WM). Magnetic resonance imaging and pathology studies have shown different degrees of WM abnormality during the progression of AD. Myelin sheaths, the main component of WM in the CNS, wrap and insulate axons to ensure conduction of the rapid action potential and axonal integrity. WM damage is characterized by progressive degeneration of axons, oligodendrocytes (OLs), and myelin in one or more areas of the CNS. The contributions of OLs to AD progression have, until recently, been largely overlooked. OLs are integral to myelin production, and the proliferation and differentiation of OLs, an early characteristic of AD, provide a promising target for preclinical diagnosis and treatment. However, despite some progress, the key mechanisms underlying the contributions of OLs to AD remain unclear. Given the heavy burden of medical treatment, a better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying AD is vital. This review comprehensively summarize the results on WM abnormalities in AD and explores the relationship between OL progenitor cells and the pathogenesis of AD.

Cortical diffusivity metrics revealed a dependence on disease stage, with AngleR and PerpPD+ displaying biphasic relationships and ParlPD a monotonic relationship with clinical severity. The novel metrics were able to differentiate between Amyloid+ and Amyloid- controls (AngleR) and to differentiate among disease stages along the AD continuum (PerpPD+). Linear regression revealed significant associations between baseline cortical diffusivity values and subsequent 24-month longitudinal structural-MRI changes.

It remains frustratingly unclear why this protein accumulates and how it contributes to Alzheimer's Disease pathology. In one recent hypothesis, Amyloid \u03b2 is suggested to function as an antimicrobial peptide in innate immune defense within the brain, where Amyloid \u03b2 gains toxicity when it becomes abundant. This essay proposes an evolutionary explanation for why Amyloid \u03b2 expression is regulated at an optimum based on its function as a defense and how this leads to disease. Among its potential physiological functions, Amyloid \u03b2 confers benefits to reduce direct pathogen damage while this simultaneously entails cellular cost of defense. Optimal Amyloid \u03b2 expression occurs when the gain in fitness from an incremental increase is balanced by the marginal cost of this increase. It proposes that natural selection acting upon the young favored systems to maintain Amyloid \u03b2 at an optimal level through mechanisms that induce the defense and repress its expression. With age, the force of natural selection declines and permits mechanisms of negative feedback repression to degenerate. Consequently, Amyloid \u03b2 is expressed beyond its optimum. Age also elevates cumulative pathogen exposure, reduces pathogen barriers and reactivates latent pathogens. The net effect is elevated, chronic induction of Amyloid \u03b2 in the brain. The model recommends attention to innate immune negative regulation in the brain to discover ways to restore these functions toward a youthful state in the elderly.", "query": "Alzheimer"}, "36281661": {"ArticleTitle": "Blood Biomarkers from Research Use to Clinical Practice: What Must Be Done?

Vascular concentrations of INSR\u03b1-B were lower in the parietal cortex of subjects diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, positively correlating with cognitive scores, leading to a shift towards a higher INSR\u03b1-A/B ratio, consistent with cerebrovascular insulin resistance in the Alzheimer's disease brain.

Prior to death, participants were observed for a mean (SD) of 8.4 (5.3) years with annual assessments. From 2096 participants who died, 1799 (85.8%) underwent autopsy and 1767 had complete postmortem pathological examination data at the time of data analyses.

The primary outcome was cognitive impairment defined by presence of mild cognitive impairment or dementia. The secondary outcome was cognition assessed by 19 neuropsychological tests.

Intracellular accumulation of aggregated A\u03b2 in the CA1 pyramidal cells at 9 months preceded extracellular plaques that first presented in the CA1 at 16 months of age. In biochemical assays, brain glutathione (GSH) declined with age in both 3xTg-AD and non-transgenic controls, but the decline was accelerated in 3xTg-AD brains from 2 to 4 months. The decline in GSH correlated exponentially with the rise in iA\u03b2. Integrated metabolic signaling as the ratio of phospho-Akt (pAkt) to total Akt (tAkt) in the PI3kinase and mTOR pathway declined at 6, 9, and 12 months, before rising at 16 and 20 months. These pAkt/tAkt ratios correlated with both iA\u03b2 and GSH levels in a U-shaped relationship. Selective vulnerability of age-related AD-genotype-specific pAkt changes was greatest in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer. To demonstrate redox causation, iA\u03b2 accumulation was lowered in cultured middle-age adult 3xTg-AD neurons by treatment of the oxidized redox state in the neurons with exogenous cysteine.

Cognition was assessed at baseline and follow-up about 3 years later by 12 tests covering six domains. The aAD and HC groups were comparable at baseline in demographic characteristics (age, gender, and education), when they were in their early forties, while the pAD and dAD groups were older and cognitively impaired. The results on mean ARC for the four groups were significantly different, small, positive, and age-insensitive in the HC group, while ARC was negative and declined with time/disease advancement in AD. The differences between HC and aAD groups in mean ARC and domain-specific ARC were not significant, indicating a subtle PE in aAD in the early preclinical stage of AD. In the symptomatic stages of AD, there was no PE probably due to cognitive disease-related progression. PEs were the largest in the verbal domain in both the HC and aAD groups, indicating a relationship with cognitive vulnerability.

Tauopathy can impair cognitive and motor functions and has been observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). The aetiology of tauopathy remains mysterious; however, recent studies suggest that the autophagic-endolysosomal function plays an essential role in the degradation and transmission of pathological tau. We previously demonstrated that tetrandrine could ameliorate memory functions and clear amyloid plaques in transgenic AD mice by restoring autophagic-endolysosomal function. However, the efficacy of tetrandrine and the associated therapeutic mechanism in tauopathies have not been evaluated and elucidated. Novel object recognition, fear conditioning and electrophysiology were used to evaluate the effects of tetrandrine on memory functions in transgenic tau mice. Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining were employed to determine the effect of tetrandrine on autophagy and tau clearance in vivo. Calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) imaging and flow cytometry were used to delineate the role of pathological tau and tetrandrine in lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> and pH homeostasis. Biochemical BiFC fluorescence, Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining were used to evaluate degradation of hyperphosphorylated tau in vitro, whereas coculture of brain slices with isolated microglia was used to evaluate tau clearance ex vivo. We observed that tetrandrine treatment mitigated tau tangle development and corrected memory impairment in Thy1-hTau.P301S transgenic mice. Mechanistically, we showed that mutant tau expression disrupts lysosome pH by increasing two-pore channel 2 (TPC2)-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, thereby contributing to lysosome alkalinization. Tetrandrine inhibits TPC2, thereby restoring the lysosomal pH, promotes tau degradation via autophagy, and ameliorates tau aggregation. Furthermore, in an ex vivo assay, we demonstrated that tetrandrine treatment promotes pathological tau clearance by microglia. Together, these findings suggest that pathological tau disturbs endolysosomal homeostasis to impair tau clearance. This impairment results in a vicious cycle that accelerates disease pathogenesis. The success of tetrandrine in reducing tau aggregation suggests first, that tetrandrine could be an effective drug for tauopathies and second, that rescuing lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis, thereby restoring ALP function, could be an effective general strategy for the development of novel therapies for tauopathies.", "query": "Alzheimer"}, "36272739": {"ArticleTitle": "Estimation of the epidemiology of dementia and associated neuropsychiatric symptoms by applying machine learning to real-world data.", "AbstractText": "Incidence rates of dementia-related neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are not known and this hampers the assessment of their population burden.

In AD, a subpopulation of astrocytes acquires a neurotoxic phenotype which prompts them to lose typical physiological features. While the underlying molecular mechanisms are still unknown, evidence suggests that myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88) adaptor protein may play a role in coordinating these cells' immune responses in AD. Herein, we combined studies in human postmortem samples with a conditional genetic knockout mouse model to investigate the link between MyD88 and astrocytes in AD. In silico analyses of bulk and cell-specific transcriptomic data from human postmortem brains demonstrated an upregulation of MyD88 expression in astrocytes in AD versus non-AD individuals. Proteomic studies revealed an increase in glial fibrillary acidic protein in multiple brain regions of AD subjects. These studies also showed that although overall MyD88 steady-state levels were unaffected by AD, this protein was enriched in astrocytes near amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Functional studies in mice indicated that the deletion of astrocytic MyD88 protected animals from the acute synaptic toxicity and cognitive impairment caused by the intracerebroventricular administration of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2). Lastly, unbiased proteomic analysis revealed that loss of astrocytic MyD88 resulted in altered astrocyte reactivity, lower levels of immune-related proteins, and higher expression of synaptic-related proteins in response to A\u03b2.

Conversely, there is a realization that non-fibrillar (oligomeric) forms of A\u03b2 mediate toxicity in AD. Fibrillar (filamentous) aggregates of proteins across the spectrum of the primary and secondary tauopathies were the focus of recent structural studies with a filament structure based nosologic classification, but less emphasis was given to non-filamentous co-aggregates of insoluble proteins in the fractions derived from post-mortem human brains. Here, we revisited sarkosyl-soluble and -insoluble extracts to characterize tau and A\u03b2 species by quantitative targeted mass spectrometric proteomics, biochemical assays, and electron microscopy.

MTBR R3 and R4 tau peptides were most abundant in the sarkosyl-insoluble materials with a 10-fold higher concentration than N-terminal tau peptides.

We investigated whether LAB feeding could ameliorate the toxicity of A\u03b2 peptide accumulation in transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans expressing the human A\u03b2 peptide in neurons or muscle as an AD model. A\u03b2 expressed in muscle caused myopathy and worm paralysis, while A\u03b2 in neurons disturbed chemotactic activity. Among 14 screened strains, Lactococcus laudensis (LL) and Pediococcus parvulus (PP) prevented the AD worms from losing their chemotaxis behavior and becoming paralyzed by the A\u03b2 peptide.

Conversely, the mRNA level of the A\u03b2 gene did not change between LL- or PP-fed worms and the control.

However, in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, chronic exposure to A\u03b2 makes microglia to become exhausted, which reduces their phagocytic activity against A\u03b2.

What should the elderly and people with dementia do and how the society should accommodate these special groups have aroused heated discussions in the society. The goal of the medical-nursing integration model is to realize the integrated model of medical care-nursing-rehabilitation-old care, and to better satisfy the needs by providing medical services, rehabilitation care, and health management. The medical needs of the elderly can help the elderly maintain a healthy state; the elderly care needs can be better met through elderly care services, and the burden on families and society can be reduced. With the advancement of the medical-care integration model, new solutions have been provided for the management of senile dementia patients. Therefore, under the medical-care integration model, this paper managed Alzheimer's patients based on the big data algorithm based on association rules and compared it with the management of Alzheimer's patients under the traditional model, and drew the following conclusions: compared with the management satisfaction of Alzheimer's patients under the traditional model, family members and patients' total satisfaction with nursing management under the medical-care integration model was greatly improved; compared with the management of Alzheimer's patients under the traditional model, the incidence of adverse events in the management of Alzheimer's patients under the medical-care integration model was greatly reduced, which was reduced to 17.6%; under the medical-care integration model, the anxiety and depression scores of the elderly patients with dementia decreased rapidly; under the medical-care integration model, the living ability of senile dementia patients has been greatly improved; the use of the medical-care integration model to manage senile dementia patients has greatly improved the sleep quality, mental quality, and quality of life of senile dementia patients.", "query": "Alzheimer"}, "36267702": {"ArticleTitle": "Role of mitophagy in the neurodegenerative diseases and its pharmacological advances: A review.", "AbstractText": "Neurodegenerative diseases are a class of incurable and debilitating diseases characterized by progressive degeneration and death of cells in the central nervous system.

Additionally, simulations were performed to model effects of (large(r)) flow changes on BPND and SUVr in different binding categories. Thereafter, %bias for SUVr with respect to underlying binding and flow were evaluated. Results in SCD and AD showed only minor differences between SUVr and BPND %change.

Application of the VLM in a 2017 study failed to find different variant loads in AD patients compared to controls, in two cohorts of European origin. The study also suggested a lower variant load in healthy elderly individuals, but could offer no replicate cohort to support this observation. Here, the VLM is applied to Japanese mtDNA sequences; in doing so, we explored the role of mtDNA variation in AD and ageing in a different global population. Consistent with the previous findings using the VLM in two populations of European origin, we found no evidence for an association between rarer, non-haplogroup associated variation and the development of AD. However, the result in the context of ageing that suggested those with fewer mildly deleterious mutations might undergo healthier ageing, was not replicated. In contrast to our previous study, our present results suggest that those living to advanced old age may harbour more mildly deleterious mtDNA variations. Importantly our analysis showed this finding is not primarily being driven by many rare population variants dispersed across the mtDNA, but by a few more frequent variants with high MutPred scores.

We used CSF markers to determine A/T/N stage using amyloid beta42/40 ratio, p-tau181 and total-tau respectively in predementia Alzheimer's disease cases (<i>n</i> = 176) [including cases that progressed to dementia (<i>n</i> = 10)] and controls (<i>n</i> = 74) from the Norwegian Dementia Disease Initiation cohort. We selected cases at the presumed early (A+/T-/N-, <i>n</i> = 86) and late stages (A+/T+/N+, <i>n</i> = 90) of the Alzheimer's disease continuum and controlled with normal markers (A-/T-/N-, <i>n</i> = 74). A subset of subjects in all A/T/N groups underwent repeat CSF sampling at approximately 2-year intervals up to 6 years from baseline. Using linear mixed models, longitudinal measurements of CSF BACE1 and neurogranin levels in A+/T-/N- and A+/T+/N+ as compared to A-/T-/N- healthy controls were performed. Next, we measured changes in CSF BACE1 and neurogranin levels in cases that progressed from A-/T-/N- to A+/T-/N- (<i>n</i> = 12), from A+/T-/N- to A+/T or N+ (<i>n</i> = 12), remained stable A+/T-/N- (<i>n</i> = 26), remained stable A+/T+/N+ (<i>n</i> = 28) compared with controls remaining stable A-/T-/N- (<i>n</i> = 33). Lastly, associations between these markers and memory decline were assessed. Compared with A-/T-/N- healthy controls, neurogranin was unaltered in A+/T-/N- (n.s.) but higher in A+/T+/N+ (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.0001). In contrast, BACE1 was lower in A+/T-/N- (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) and higher in A+/T+/N+ (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.0001). The neurogranin/BACE1 ratio was increased in both A+/T-/N- (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) and A+/T+/N+ (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.0001) groups as compared to A-/T-/N- healthy controls and was more strongly associated with memory decline (b = -0.29, <i>P</i> = 0.0006) than neurogranin (b = -0.20, <i>P</i> = 0.002) and BACE1 (b = -0.13, <i>P</i> = 0.046). Neurogranin and BACE1 level differences remained stable over time not only within A/T/N groups but also in patients progressing to more pathological A/T/N stages (e.g. progressing from A+/T-/N- to A + T or N+) and in cases progressing to dementia.

The MEMENTO cohort enrolled 2323 outpatients with subjective cognitive complaint (SCC) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) consulting in 26 French memory clinics. Participants had neuropsychological assessments, MRI and blood sampling at baseline. CSF sampling and amyloid PET were optional. Baseline blood A\u03b242/40 ratio, total-tau, p181-tau, and neurofilament light chain (NfL) were measured using a Simoa HD-X analyzer. An expert committee validated incident dementia cases during a 5-year follow-up period. Overall, 2277 individuals had at least one baseline blood biomarker available (n=357 for CSF subsample, n=649 for PET subsample), among whom 257 were diagnosed with clinical AD/mixed dementia during follow-up.

However, the relationships between protein synthesis deregulation and ER stress/UPR, as well as their role in the altered homeostatic support of Alzheimer's disease (AD) astrocytes remain poorly understood. Previously, we reported that in astrocytic cell lines from 3xTg-AD mice (3Tg-iAstro) protein synthesis was impaired and ER-mitochondria distance was reduced. Here we show that impaired protein synthesis in 3Tg-iAstro is associated with an increase of p-eIF2\u03b1 and downregulation of GADD34. Although mRNA levels of ER stress/UPR markers were increased two-three-fold, we found neither activation of PERK nor downstream induction of ATF4 protein. Strikingly, the overexpression of a synthetic ER-mitochondrial linker (EML) resulted in a reduced protein synthesis and augmented p-eIF2\u03b1 without any effect on ER stress/UPR marker genes. In vivo, in hippocampi of 3xTg-AD mice, reduced protein synthesis, increased p-eIF2\u03b1 and downregulated GADD34 protein were found, while no increase of p-PERK or ATF4 proteins was observed, suggesting that in AD astrocytes, both in vitro and in vivo, phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 and impairment of protein synthesis are PERK-independent.

However, increased levels of hIAPP in prediabetic and diabetic patients can lead to the formation of hIAPP protofibrils, which are toxic to \u03b2 cells.

Using a stabilizing capping protein, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can be developed against a previously nonisolatable form of hIAPP protofibrils, which are protofibril specific and do not engage monomeric hIAPP.

Delivery of biotherapeutics to the brain can be enabled through receptor-mediated transcytosis via proteins such as the transferrin receptor, although limitations such as the ability to use Fc-mediated effector function to clear pathogenic targets can introduce safety liabilities. Hence, novel delivery approaches with alternative clearance mechanisms are warranted. Binders that optimized transport across the BBB, known as transcytosis-enabling modules (TEMs), were identified using a combination of antibody discovery techniques and pharmacokinetic analyses. Functional activity of TEMs were subsequently evaluated by imaging for the ability of myeloid cells to phagocytose target proteins and cells. We demonstrated significantly enhanced brain exposure of therapeutic antibodies using optimal transferrin receptor or CD98 TEMs. We found that these modules also mediated efficient clearance of tau aggregates and HER2+ tumor cells via a non-classical phagocytosis mechanism through direct engagement of myeloid cells.

This systematic review followed the PRISMA Statement guidelines through the 27 items on its checklist. We searched in PubMed, BVS, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library, using the keywords: Alzheimer's disease, optical coherence tomography, white matter, cortex, atrophy, cortical thickness, neuroimaging, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography. We included articles that studied the retina in relation to neuroimaging in patients with AD, MCI, and preclinical AD. We excluded studies without OCT, without neuroimaging, clinical cases, opinion articles, systematic reviews, and animal studies. Of a total of 35 articles found, 23 were finally included. Although mixed results were found, most of these corroborate the relationship between retinal and brain disorders. More rigorous research is needed in the field, including homogenized, longitudinal, and prolonged follow-up studies, as well as studies that include all stages of AD. This will enable better understanding of the retina and its implications in AD, leading to the discovery of retinal biomarkers that reflect brain alterations in AD patients in an accessible and noninvasive manner.", "query": "Alzheimer"}, "36254682": {"ArticleTitle": "Lipopolysaccharide distinctively alters human microglia transcriptomes to resemble microglia from Alzheimer's disease mouse models.", "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, and risk-influencing genetics implicates microglia and neuroimmunity in the pathogenesis of AD.

We performed a detailed cross-comparison over time on the effects of combinatory stimulation of iPSC-microglia, and in particular their relevance to AD. We used single-cell RNA sequencing to measure the transcriptional response of iPSC-microglia after 24\u2005h and 48\u2005h of stimulation with prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS)+interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3), either alone or in combination with ATP\u03b3S.

Structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, single-positron emission computer tomography, and electroencephalography assessments of patients revealed widespread abnormalities within and across brain networks in DLB. Frontoparietal, default mode, and visual networks and their connections to other brain regions featured the most consistent disruptions, which were also associated with core clinical features and cognitive impairments. Furthermore, graph theoretical measures revealed disease-related decreases in local and global network efficiency. This systematic review shows that structural and functional connectivity characteristics in DLB may be particularly valuable at early stages, before overt brain atrophy can be observed.

Our combined analysis of the tau interactome revealed consistent enrichment of interactions between tau and proteins involved in RNA binding, ribosome, and proteasome function. Comparison of human and rodent tau interactome studies revealed substantial differences between the two species. We also performed a second analysis to identify the tau interacting proteins that are enriched in neurons containing granulovacuolar degeneration or neurofibrillary tangle pathology.

In the more challenging task of detecting MCI, it achieves an AUC of 62.45. It is also significantly faster than the volume/thickness model in which the volumes and thickness need to be extracted beforehand. The model can also be used to forecast progression: subjects with mild cognitive impairment misclassified as having mild Alzheimer's disease dementia by the model were faster to progress to dementia over time. An analysis of the features learned by the proposed model shows that it relies on a wide range of regions associated with Alzheimer's disease.

The sorting of this enzyme into Rab11-positive recycling endosomes regulates the BACE1-mediated cleavage of its substrates, however, the mechanisms underlying this targeting remain poorly understood. The neural cell adhesion molecule 2 (NCAM2) is a substrate of BACE1. We show that BACE1 cleaves NCAM2 in cultured hippocampal neurons and NCAM2-transfected CHO cells. The C-terminal fragment of NCAM2 that comprises the intracellular domain and a small portion of NCAM2's extracellular domain, associates with BACE1. This association is not affected in cells with inhibited endocytosis, indicating that the interaction of NCAM2 and BACE1 precedes the targeting of BACE1 from the cell surface to endosomes. In neurons and CHO cells, this fragment and BACE1 co-localize in Rab11-positive endosomes. Overexpression of full-length NCAM2 or a recombinant NCAM2 fragment containing the transmembrane and intracellular domains but lacking the extracellular domain leads to an increase in BACE1 levels in these organelles. In NCAM2-deficient neurons, the levels of BACE1 are increased at the cell surface and reduced in intracellular organelles. These effects are correlated with increased levels of the soluble extracellular domain of BACE1 in the brains of NCAM2-deficient mice, suggesting increased shedding of BACE1 from the cell surface. Of note, shedding of the extracellular domain of Sez6, a protein cleaved exclusively by BACE1, is reduced in NCAM2-deficient animals.

Oat seedlings contain more protein, beta-glucan, free amino acids, and phenolic compounds than seeds. The progressive neurodegenerative disorder of Alzheimer's is accompanied by worsening memory and cognitive function. A key indicator of this disorder is the unusual buildup of amyloid-beta protein (or A\u03b2) in human brains. In this context, oat seedling extract (OSE) has been identified as a new therapeutic candidate for AD, due to its antioxidant activity and AD-specific mechanism of action. This study directly investigated how OSE affected AD and its impacts by examining the cognitive function and exploring the inflammatory response mechanism. The dried oat seedlings were grounded finely with a grinder, inserted with 50% fermented ethanol 10 times (<i>w</i>/<i>v</i>), and extracted by stirring for 10 h at 45 \u00b0C.

Protein aggregates are often associated with neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we sought to determine how FAIM protein dynamics change during cellular stress and how FAIM prevents the formation of amyloid-\u03b2 aggregates/fibrils, one of the pathological hallmarks of AD. Here, we found that the majority of FAIM protein shifts to the detergent-insoluble fraction in response to cellular stress. A similar shift to the insoluble fraction was also observed in small heat shock protein (sHSP) family molecules, such as HSP27, after stress. We further demonstrate that FAIM is recruited to sHSP-containing complexes after cellular stress induction. These data suggest that FAIM might prevent protein aggregation in concert with sHSPs. In fact, we observed the additional effect of FAIM and HSP27 on the prevention of protein aggregates using an in vitro amyloid-\u03b2 aggregation model system.

However, the link between 27-OHC and cholesterol homeostasis, and how this relationship relates to AD pathogenesis, remain elusive. Here, 12-month-old ApoE \u03b54 transgenic mice were injected with saline, 27-OHC, 27-OHC synthetase inhibitor (anastrozole, ANS), and 27-OHC+ANS for 21 consecutive days.

The indicators of cholesterol metabolism, synaptic structure, amyloid \u03b2 1-42 (A\u03b21-42), and learning and memory abilities were measured. Compared with the wild-type mice, ApoE \u03b54 mice had poor memory and dysregulated cholesterol metabolism. Additionally, damaged brain tissue and synaptic structure, cognitive decline, and higher A\u03b21-42 levels were observed in the 27-OHC group. Moreover, cholesterol transport proteins such as ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), apolipoprotein E (ApoE), low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein1 (LRP1) were up-regulated in the cortex after the 27-OHC treatment. The levels of cholesterol metabolism-related indicators in the hippocampus were not consistent with those in the cortex.

We identified two groups both males and females, subsequently used for our statistical comparisons: the high CHI3L1 expression group (HCEG) and the low CHI3L1 expression group (LCEG). Comparing HCEG to LCEG, we attained four signatures according to the sex of patients, in order to identify the healthy and AD brain cellular architecture, performing a genomic deconvolution analysis. We used neurological signatures (NS) belonging to six neurological cells populations and nine signatures that included the main physiological neurological processes. We discovered that, in the brains of NDHC the high expression levels of CHI3L1 were associated with astrocyte activation profile, while in AD males and females we showed an inflammatory profile microglia-mediated. The low CHI3L1 brain expression levels in NDHC and AD patients highlighted a neuronal activation profile. Furthermore, using drugs opposing CHI3L1 transcriptomic signatures, we found a specific drug profile for AD males and females characterized by high levels of CHI3L1 composed of fostamatinib, rucaparib, cephaeline, prednisolone, and dinoprostone.

This heterogeneity, leading to temporally distinct age at onset (AAO) and stages of cognitive decline, may be caused by myriad combinations of distinct disease-associated molecular mechanisms.

Areas of the brain less affected by AD pathology at early disease stages-such as the primary visual cortex-exhibit similar transcriptomic dysregulation as those regions traditionally affected and, therefore, may offer a view into the molecular mechanisms of AD without the associated inflammatory changes and gliosis induced by pathology (Haroutunian et al.

We identified 15 studies featuring participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD), behavioral variant - Frontotemporal dementia (bv-FTD), acquired brain damage, and depression.

Participants with bv-FTD had fewer AMs evoked after both music and pictures than healthy controls. Across conditions, MEAMs were generally specific and retrieved fast, suggesting little retrieval effort. MEAMs were also positive, except in depression, where as many negative as positive AMs were produced. These findings suggest several underlying cognitive and affective mechanisms of MEAMs, including anxiety reduction, increased fluency, music-evoked emotions, reminiscence, and involuntary retrieval, and that these might be moderated by musical abilities and memory for music.

This study aimed to investigate how whole-brain networks are influenced at pre- and early-plague stages of AD and if these manifestations are associated with concomitant cellular and synaptic deficits.\u00a0 METHODS: To this end, we used an established AD rat model (TgF344-AD) and employed resting state functional MRI and quasi-periodic pattern (QPP) analysis, a method to detect recurrent spatiotemporal motifs of brain activity, in parallel with state-of-the-art immunohistochemistry in selected brain regions. At the pre-plaque stage, QPPs in TgF344-AD rats showed decreased activity of the basal forebrain (BFB) and the default mode-like network. Histological analyses revealed increased astrocyte abundance restricted to the BFB, in the absence of amyloid plaques, tauopathy, and alterations in a number of cholinergic, gaba-ergic, and glutamatergic synapses. During the early-plaque stage, when mild amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) accumulation was observed in the cortex and hippocampus, QPPs in the TgF344-AD rats normalized suggesting the activation of compensatory mechanisms during this early disease progression period. Interestingly, astrogliosis observed in the BFB at the pre-plaque stage was absent at the early-plaque stage. Moreover, altered excitatory/inhibitory balance was observed in cortical regions belonging to the default mode-like network. In wild-type rats, at both time points, peak activity in the BFB preceded peak activity in other brain regions-indicating its modulatory role during QPPs. However, this pattern was eliminated in TgF344-AD suggesting that alterations in BFB-directed neuromodulation have a pronounced impact in network function in AD. This study demonstrates the value of rsfMRI and advanced network analysis methods to detect early alterations in BFB function in AD, which could aid early diagnosis and intervention in AD.

Altered function of peripheral innate immune cells was found in AD and PD and thus contributed to the development and progression of AD and PD. Alteration of different subsets of T cells was found in the peripheral blood and CNS in AD and PD. The CNS-infiltrating T cells can exert both neuroprotective and neurotoxic effects in the pathogenesis and progression.

This study assesses the cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical DMT with a limited treatment duration in AD. We developed a Markov state-transition model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical DMT plus best supportive care (BSC) versus BSC alone among Americans living with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD or mild AD. AD states included MCI due to AD, mild AD, moderate AD, severe AD, and death. A hypothetical DMT was assumed to confer a 30% reduction in progression from MCI and mild AD. The base case annual drug acquisition cost was assumed to be $56,000. Other medical and indirect costs were obtained from published literature or list prices. Utilities for patients and caregivers were obtained from the published literature and varied by AD state and care setting (community care or long-term care). We considered 3 DMT treatment strategies: (1) treatment administered until patients reached severe AD (continuous strategy), (2) treatment administered for a maximum duration of 18 months or when patients reached severe AD (fixed-duration strategy), and (3) 40% of patients discontinuing treatment at 6 months because of amyloid plaque clearance and the remaining patients continuing treatment until 18 months or until they reached severe AD (test-and-discontinue strategy). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated as the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. From the health care sector perspective, continuous treatment with a hypothetical DMT versus BSC resulted in an ICER of $612,354 per QALY gained. The ICER decreased to $157,288 per QALY gained in the fixed-duration strategy, driven by large reductions in treatment costs. With 40% of patients discontinuing treatment at 6 months (test-and-discontinue strategy), the ICER was $125,631 per QALY gained. In sensitivity and scenario analyses, the ICER was the most sensitive to changes in treatment efficacy, treatment cost, and the initial population AD state distribution. From the modified societal perspective, ICERs were 6.3%, 20.4%, and 25.1% lower than those from the health care sector perspective for the continuous, fixed-duration, and test-and-discontinue strategies, respectively.

Identifying systematic differences between RSNs in patients, i.e. discovering neurofunctional subtypes, may further increase our understanding of disease heterogeneity. Currently, no methodology is available to estimate neurofunctional subtypes and their associated RSNs simultaneously. We present an unsupervised learning method for fMRI data, called Clusterwise Independent Component Analysis (C-ICA). This enables the clustering of patients into neurofunctional subtypes based on differences in shared ICA-derived RSNs. The parameters are estimated simultaneously, which leads to an improved estimation of subtypes and their associated RSNs. In five simulation studies, the C-ICA model is successfully validated using both artificially and realistically simulated data (N\u00a0=\u00a030-40). The successful performance of the C-ICA model is also illustrated on an empirical data set consisting of Alzheimer's disease patients and elderly control subjects (N\u00a0=\u00a0250). C-ICA is able to uncover a meaningful clustering that partially matches (balanced accuracy = .72) the diagnostic labels and identifies differences in RSNs between the Alzheimer and control cluster. Both in the simulation study and the empirical application, C-ICA yields better results compared to competing clustering methods (i.e., a two step clustering procedure based on single subject ICA's and a Group ICA plus dual regression variant thereof) that do not simultaneously estimate a clustering and associated RSNs. Indeed, the overall mean adjusted Rand Index, a measure for cluster recovery, equals 0.65 for C-ICA and ranges from 0.27 to 0.46 for competing methods. The successful performance of C-ICA indicates that it is a promising method to extract neurofunctional subtypes from multi-subject resting state-fMRI data.

We investigated the feasibility of intranasal delivery of MSNs-Bifidobacterium (MSNs-Bi) to the gut and their effect on behavior and brain pathology in APP/PS1 mice. Mesoporous silica nanospheres (MSNs) were efficiently immobilized on the surface of Bifidobacterium. After intranasal administration, fluorescence imaging of MSNs-Bi in the abdominal cavity and gastrointestinal tract revealed that intranasally delivered MSNs-Bi could be transported through the brain to the peripheral intestine. Intranasal administration of MSNs-Bi not only inhibited intestinal inflammation and reduced brain A\u03b2 burden but also improved olfactory sensitivity in APP/PS1 mice. These findings suggested that restoring the balance of the gut microbiome contributes to ameliorating cognitive impairment in AD, and that intranasal administration of MSNs-Bi may be an effective therapeutic strategy for the prevention of AD and intestinal disease.", "query": "Alzheimer"}, "36207441": {"ArticleTitle": "Alzheimer's disease: insights from a network medicine perspective.", "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease that currently lacks available effective therapy.

However, the translational validity of <i>APOE4</i> mouse models for AD-related cognitive impairment remains to be fully determined. The present study investigated the role of both sex and genotype on learning and memory in aged, humanized <i>APOE</i> knock-in mice. Aged (23.27 mo \u00b1 1.21 mo; 39 male/37 female) <i>APOE3/3</i>, <i>APOE3/4</i>, and <i>APOE4/4</i> mice performed a novel object recognition (NOR) assay.

Prior to NOR, female mice exhibited thigmotaxic center zone avoidance during the open field task relative to males, regardless of genotype. Within object familiarization and NOR tasks, females had greater object interaction and locomotion. Interestingly, only <i>APOE4/4</i> females on average recognized the novel object. These results suggest that <i>APOE4</i>, although strongly related to LOAD pathogenesis, does not drive cognitive decline in the absence of other risk factors even in very aged mice. Chromosomal sex is a key driver of behavioral phenotypes and thus is a critical variable for translatability of interventions designed to preserve learning and memory in animal models of LOAD.

The studies show high heterogeneity in duration, response definition, drug dosage, and diagnostic criteria. Response to AChEI seems associated with correlates of cholinergic deficit (hallucinations, fluctuating cognition, substantia innominate atrophy) and preserved cholinergic neurons (faster alpha on REM sleep EEG, increased anterior frontal and parietal lobe perfusion after donepezil); white matter hyperintensities in the cholinergic pathways have shown inconsistent results. The K-variant of butyrylcholinesterase may correlate with better response in late stages of disease, while the role of polymorphisms in other genes involved in the cholinergic system is controversial.

This study established a framework that unifies the processes of identifying a brain connectivity-based biomarker and mapping its abnormality level into a single numerical value, called a biomarker abnormality summarized from the identified connectivity (BASIC) score. A connectivity-based biomarker was extracted in the form of a connected component associated with disease progression. BASIC scores were constructed to maximize Kendall's rank correlation with the disease, considering the spatial autocorrelation between adjacent edges. Using functional connectivity networks, we validated the BASIC scores in various scenarios. Our proposed framework was successfully applied to construct connectivity-based biomarker scores associated with disease progression, characterized by two, three, and five stages of Alzheimer's disease, and reflected the continuity of brain alterations as the diseases advanced. The BASIC scores were not only sensitive to disease progression, but also specific to the trajectory of a particular disease. Moreover, this framework can be utilized when disease stages are measured on continuous scales, resulting in a notable prediction performance when applied to the prediction of the disease. Our unified framework provides a method to identify brain connectivity-based biomarkers and continuity-reflecting BASIC scores that are sensitive and specific to disease progression.", "query": "Alzheimer"}, "36203603": {"ArticleTitle": "<i>Bifidobacterium breve</i> intervention combined with environmental enrichment alleviates cognitive impairment by regulating the gut microbiota and microbial metabolites in Alzheimer's disease mice.", "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by behavioral and cognitive impairments and its increasing prevalence imposes a healthcare burden on society.

Previous studies showed that high emissions of aldehydes (formaldehyde and acetaldehyde) in aerosols were associated with increased usage of the same e-cigarette coils. However, the impact on lung function of using aged coils has not been reported. We investigated the relationship between coil age and acute lung injury in mice exposed to experimental vaping for 1\u00a0h (2 puffs/min, 100\u00a0ml/puff). The e-liquid contains propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin (50:50, vol) only. The concentrations of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde in the vaping aerosols increased with age of the nichrome coils starting at 1200 puffs. Mice exposed to e-cigarette aerosols produced from 1800, but not 0 or 900, puff-aged coils caused acute lung injury, increased lung wet/dry weight ratio, and induced lung inflammation (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, MIP-2). Exposure to vaping aerosols from 1800 puff-aged coils decreased heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation in mice compared to mice exposed to air or aerosols from new coils. In conclusion, we observed that the concentration of aldehydes (formaldehyde and acetaldehyde) increased with repeated and prolonged usage of e-cigarette coils. Exposure to high levels of aldehyde in vaping aerosol was associated with acute lung injury in mice.

The main reason is hormonal senescence after menopause, a period characterized by a decline in estrogen levels. Since the effectiveness of drugs currently approved for the treatment of AD is limited, it is necessary to seek the development of new therapeutic strategies. Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in AD patients and individuals with dementia in general. The supplementation of this vitamin in dementia patients might be an interesting approach for increasing the effectiveness of pre-existing medications for dementia treatment. Thus, the present study aims to investigate the effect of vitamin D treatment associated with memantine and donepezil in female mice submitted to ovariectomy (OVX) for five months and subjected to a dementia animal model induced by intracerebroventricular injection of aggregated amyloid \u03b2eta (A\u03b2<sub>1-42</sub>). For this purpose, Balb/c mice were divided into five experimental groups, which received 17\u202fdays of combined therapy with vitamin D, donepezil, and memantine. Then, animals were subjected to behavioral tests. OVX groups exhibited reduced levels of E2 in serum, which was not altered by the combined therapy. Higher levels of vitamin D3 were found in the OVX animals submitted to the triple-association treatment. Mice exposed to both OVX and the dementia animal model presented impairment in short and long-term spatial and habituation memories. Also, female mice exposed to A\u03b2 and OVX exhibited a reduction in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) levels, and an increase in tumor necrose factor-\u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) levels in the hippocampus. Besides, increased levels of IL-1\u03b2 in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex were observed, as well as a significant increase in immunoreactivity for GFAP, an astrocytes marker, in the hippocampus. Notably, triple-association treatment reversed the effects of the exposition of mice to A\u03b2 and OVX in the long-term spatial and habituation memories impairment, as well as reversed changes in TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-4, and GFAP immunoreactivity levels in the hippocampus of treated animals.

As a result, anti-oxidative stress and attenuating A\u03b2 accumulation might be one promising intervention for AD treatment. Tanshinone IIA (Tan IIA), a major component of lipophilic tanshinones in Danshen, is proven to be effective in several diseases, including AD. Due to the poor solubility in water, the clinical application of Tan IIA was limited. Therefore, a great number of nanoparticles were designed to overcome this issue. In the current study, we choose chitson as delivery carrier to load Tanshinone IIA (CS@Tan IIA) and explore the protective effects of CS@Tan IIA on the CL2006 strain, a transgenic C. elegans of AD model organism. Compared with Tan IIA monomer, CS@Tan IIA could significantly prolong the lifespan and attenuate the AD-like symptoms, including reducing paralysis and the A\u03b2 deposition by inhibiting the oxidative stress. The mechanism study showed that the protection of CS@Tan IIA was attenuated by knockdown of daf-16 gene, but not skn-1. The results indicated that DAF-16/SOD-3 pathway was required in the protective effects of CS@Tan IIA. Besides DAF-16/SOD-3 pathway, the Tan IIA-loaded CS nanoparticles might protect the C. elegans against the AD insults via promoting autophagy.

Astrocytes have special highly ramified structure. Their branches contact with synapses of neurons inwardly, with fine structure and wrapping synapses; their feet contact with blood vessels of brain parenchyma outward, almost wrapping the whole brain. The adjacent astrocytes rarely overlap and communicate with each other through gap junction channels.

The results indicated that compound 21 has the most potent inhibition against eeAChE (IC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.20\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02\u00a0\u03bcM), hAChE (IC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.34\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01\u00a0\u03bcM) and GSK-3\u03b2 (IC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a01.14\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.05\u00a0\u03bcM) among these compounds. In addition, it inhibited hAChE in a mixed type manner and could occupy the binding pocket forming diverse interactions with the target of AChE and GSK-3\u03b2. Moreover, compound 21 showed low cytotoxicity against SH-SY5Y and HepG2 cell lines and good BBB permeability. Compound 21 also attenuated the tau hyperphosphorylation in the Tau (P301L) 293T cell model. The ADME projection exhibited that compound 21 has acceptable physicochemical characteristics.

Similarly, many mouse models of Alzheimer's disease that overproduce amyloid beta are prone to epileptiform seizures that may result in early sudden death. We studied one such model, designated <i>APP/PS1</i>, and found that mutation of the TAM receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) Mer or its ligand Gas6 greatly exacerbated early death. Lethality was tied to violent seizures that appeared to initiate in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus, where Mer plays an essential role in the microglial phagocytosis of both apoptotic and newborn cells normally generated during adult neurogenesis. We found that newborn DG neurons and excitatory synapses between the DG and the cornu ammonis field 3 (CA3) field of the hippocampus were increased in TAM-deficient mice, and that premature death and adult neurogenesis in these mice were coincident. In contrast, the incidence of lethal seizures and the deposition of dense-core amyloid plaques were strongly anticorrelated.

Additionally, abnormal protein accumulation due to autophagic deficiency may also be involved in disease progression. Autophagy involves a mechanism called selective autophagy. However, the relationship between selective autophagy and the amyloid precursor protein (APP) remains unclear. In the present study, we analyzed the interaction between p62, an adapter protein, and an APP-related molecule, and found that p62 interacted with the C-terminal fragment of APP (C60). When C60 and p62 are overexpressed, aggregates are formed, and C60 is degraded by autophagy. These aggregates cannot be easily degraded, even with a reducing agent. We also found that autophagosome- and lysosome-marker-positive vesicles were formed in the C60- and p62-expressing cells. Super resolution technology also revealed that p62-C60-positive autophagosomes were formed in the cells. Overall, these results suggest that p62 may bind with C60 to form aggregates and induce autophagy in autophagosomes.

Unfortunately, once individuals are diagnosed with the disease, there are few therapeutic options available. There is neither an effective symptomatic treatment, one that treats the debilitating cognitive and memory deficits, nor, more importantly, a neuroprotective treatment, one that stops the relentless progression of the pathology.

More than one third of patients with COVID-19 develop neurologic problems during the acute phase of the illness, including loss of sense of smell or taste, seizures, and stroke. Damage or functional changes to the brain may result in chronic sequelae.

We also provide a comprehensive description of the Alzheimer's Association Consortium on Chronic Neuropsychiatric Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (CNS SC2) harmonized methodology to address these questions using a worldwide network of researchers and institutions. Successful harmonization of designs and methods was achieved through a consensus process initially fragmented by specific interest groups (epidemiology, clinical assessments, cognitive evaluation, biomarkers, and neuroimaging). Conclusions from subcommittees were presented to the whole group and discussed extensively. Presently data collection is ongoing at 19 sites in 12 countries representing Asia, Africa, the Americas, and Europe.

No available evidence supports the notion that cognitive impairment after SARS-CoV-2 infection is a form of dementia (ADRD or otherwise). The longitudinal methodologies espoused by the consortium are intended to provide data to answer this question as clearly as possible controlling for possible confounders. Our specific hypothesis is that SARS-CoV-2 triggers ADRD-like pathology following the extended olfactory cortical network (EOCN) in older individuals with specific genetic susceptibility.The proposed harmonization strategies and flexible study designs offer the possibility to include large samples of under-represented racial and ethnic groups, creating a rich set of harmonized cohorts for future studies of the pathophysiology, determinants, long-term consequences, and trends in cognitive aging, ADRD, and vascular disease.We provide a framework for current and future studies to be carried out within the Consortium. and offers a &quot;green paper&quot; to the research community with a very broad, global base of support, on tools suitable for low- and middle-income countries aimed to compare and combine future longitudinal data on the topic.The Consortium proposes a combination of design and statistical methods as a means of approaching causal inference of the COVID-19 neuropsychiatric sequelae.

Two other anti-amyloid immunotherapies showed significant results regarding a clinical outcome in phase 2 trials, and five drugs are being studied in phase 3 trials.

Clinically, the Aconitum medicinal materials must undergo a complex processing process that includes soaking, steaming, and boiling with pharmaceutical excipients, which makes highly toxic ester diterpenoid alkaloids are hydrolyzed to form less toxic aminoalcohol-diterpenoid alkaloids (ADAs). This review aims to summarize the pharmacokinetic and pharmacological activities of low-toxicity ADAs, providing a reference for future ADAs research and drug development. Accessible literature on ADAs published between 1984 and 2022 were screened and obtained from available electronic databases such as PubMed, Web of Science, Springer, Science Direct and Google Scholar, followed by systematic analysis. ADAs are secondary products of plant metabolism, widely distributed in the Aconitum species and Delphinium species. The toxicity of ADAs as pharmacodynamic components of Aconitum medicinal materials is much lower than that of other diterpenoid alkaloids due to the absence of ester bonds. On the one hand, the pharmacokinetics of ADAs have received little attention compared to other toxic alkaloids. The research primarily focuses on aconine and mesaconine. According to existing studies, ADAs absorption in the gastrointestinal tract is primarily passive with a short T<sub>max</sub>. Simultaneously, efflux transporters have less impact on ADAs absorption than non-ADAs. After entering the body, ADAs are widely distributed in the heart, liver, lungs, and kidney, but less in the brain. Notably, aconine is not well metabolized by liver microsomes. Aconine and mesaconine are excreted in urine and feces, respectively. ADAs, on the other hand, have been shown to have a variety of pharmacological activities, including cardiac, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, antioxidant, and regenerative effects via regulating multiple signaling pathways, including Nrf2/ARE, PERK/eIF2\u03b1/ATF4/Chop, ERK/CREB, NF-\u03baB, Bcl-2/Bax, and GSK3\u03b2/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathways. ADAs have been shown to have beneficial effects on heart disease, neurological disease, and other systemic diseases. Moreover, ADAs have low toxicity and a wide range of safe doses.

Owing to crucial roles of biomarkers in the AD, the detection of AD-related biomarkers may be suitable for predictive identification of AD. Biosensors is a novel tool that could be beneficial to appreciate recognition of several AD biomarkers as early as possible. Graphene and its derivatives containing graphene oxide (GO) and reduced-GO (rGO) can be good choice for biosensing approaches due to their unique properties. GO/rGO-based biosensors or nanosensors have been widely used for the determination of AD biomarkers. In this article, the general aspects of AD, its biomarkers, biosensors, and GO are overviewed. In addition, this review provides the current developments in the applications of graphene-based biosensors for recognition of AD biomarkers.

Treatment with hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) and H<sub>2</sub>S donors such as sodium hydrosulfide (NaSH) can reduce oxidative stress in preclinical studies, however clinical benefits of such treatments are rather ambiguous. This is partly due to poor stability and bioavailability of the H<sub>2</sub>S donors, requiring impractically large doses that are associated with dose-limiting toxicity. Herein, we identified a bioavailable 3-mercaptopyruvate prodrug, sulfanegen, which is able to pose as a sacrificial redox substrate for 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3MST), one of the H<sub>2</sub>S biosynthetic enzymes in the brain. Sulfanegen is able to mitigate toxicity emanating from oxidative insults and the A\u03b2<sub>1-42</sub> peptide by releasing H<sub>2</sub>S through the 3MST pathway. When administered to symptomatic transgenic mouse model of AD (APP/PS1; 7 and 12 months) and mice that were intracerebroventricularly administered with the A\u03b2<sub>1-42</sub> peptide, sulfanegen was able to reverse oxidative and neuroinflammatory consequences of AD pathology by restoring 3MST function. Quantitative neuropathological analyses confirmed significant disease modifying effect of the compound on amyloid plaque burden and brain inflammatory markers. More importantly, sulfanegen treatment attenuated progressive neurodegeneration in these mice, as evident from the restoration of TH+\u00a0neurons in the locus coeruleus. This study demonstrates a previously unknown concept that supplementation of 3MST function in the brain may be a viable approach for the management of AD.

A key question is whether adoptive transfer of ex vivo expanded human Tregs can suppress neuroinflammation and amyloid pathology in a preclinical mouse model. An immunodeficient mouse model of AD was generated by backcrossing the 5xFAD onto Rag2 knockout mice (5xFAD-Rag2KO). Human Tregs were expanded ex vivo for 24\u00a0days and administered to 5xFAD-Rag2KO.

NanoString Mouse AD multiplex gene expression analysis was applied to explore the impact of ex vivo expanded Tregs on the neuroinflammation transcriptome. Elimination of mature B and T lymphocytes and natural killer cells in 5xFAD-Rag2KO mice was associated with upregulation of 95 inflammation genes and amplified number of reactive microglia within the dentate gyrus.

A\u03b242 can undergo abnormal aggregation and amyloidogenesis in the brain, forming fibrillar plaques, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. The insoluble fibrillar forms of A\u03b242 exhibit well-defined, cross \u03b2-sheet structures at the molecular level and are less toxic than the soluble, intermediate disordered oligomeric forms. However, the mechanism of initial interaction of monomers and subsequent oligomerization is not well understood. The structural disorder of A\u03b242 adds to the challenges of determining the structural properties of its monomers, making it difficult to understand the underlying molecular mechanism of pathogenic aggregation. Certain regions of A\u03b242 are known to exhibit helical propensity in different physiological conditions. NMR spectroscopy has shown that the A\u03b242 monomer at lower pH can adopt an \u03b1-helical conformation and as the pH is increased, the peptide switches to \u03b2-sheet conformation and aggregation occurs. CD spectroscopy studies of aggregation have shown the presence of an initial spike in the amount of \u03b1-helical content at the start of aggregation. Such an increase in \u03b1-helical content suggests a mechanism wherein the peptide can expose critical non-polar residues for interaction, leading to hydrophobic aggregation with other interacting peptides. We have used molecular dynamics simulations to characterize in detail the conformational landscape of monomeric A\u03b242 in solution to identify molecular properties that may mediate the early stages of oligomerization. We hypothesized that conformations with \u03b1-helical structure have a higher probability of initiating aggregation because they increase the hydrophobicity of the peptide. Although random coil conformations were found to be the most dominant, as expected, \u03b1-helical conformations are thermodynamically accessible, more so than \u03b2-sheet conformations. Importantly, for the first time \u03b1-helical conformations are observed to increase the exposure of aromatic and hydrophobic residues to the aqueous solvent, favoring their hydrophobically driven interaction with other monomers to initiate aggregation.

DGCCA applies non-linear transformation to input views using neural networks and is able to learn correlated\u00a0embeddings with low dimensions that capture more variance than its linear counterpart, generalized CCA (GCCA). We designed experiments to compare DGCCA embeddings with single modality features and GCCA embeddings by generating 2 subtypes from each feature set using unsupervised clustering. In our validation studies, we found that amyloid PET imaging has the most discriminative features compared with structural MRI and FDG PET which DGCCA learns from but not GCCA. DGCCA subtypes show differential measures in 5 cognitive assessments, 6 brain volume measures, and conversion to AD patterns. In addition, DGCCA MCI subtypes confirmed AD genetic markers with strong signals that existing late MCI group did not identify. Overall, DGCCA is able to learn effective low dimensional embeddings from multimodal data by learning non-linear projections.

Translational control is critical for maintaining proteostasis during aging. Gaining control of the translation machinery is also crucial in the battle between viruses and their hosts. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we show that overexpression of SARS-CoV-2-encoded nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1) robustly rescued neuromuscular degeneration and behavioral phenotypes in <i>Drosophila</i> models of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. These diseases share a common mechanism: the accumulation of aberrant protein species due to the stalling and collision of translating ribosomes, leading to proteostasis failure. Our genetic and biochemical analyses revealed that Nsp1 acted in a multipronged manner to resolve collided ribosomes, abort stalled translation, and remove faulty translation products causative of disease in these models, at least in part through the ribosome recycling factor ABCE1, ribosome-associated quality-control factors, autophagy, and AKT signaling. Nsp1 exhibited exquisite specificity in its action, as it did not modify other neurodegenerative conditions not known to be associated with ribosome stalling. These findings uncover a previously unrecognized mechanism of Nsp1 in manipulating host translation, which can be leveraged for combating age-related neurodegenerative diseases that are affecting millions of people worldwide and currently without effective treatment.", "query": "Alzheimer"}, "36170055": {"ArticleTitle": "Computationally Elucidating the Binding Kinetics for Different AChE Inhibitors to Access the Rationale for Improving the Drug Efficacy.", "AbstractText": "Traditional drug discovery is based on a binding affinity (thermodynamics)-driven paradigm. Numerous examples, however, demonstrated that drug efficacy does not always depend only on binding affinity but positively correlates with binding kinetics, that is, the dissociation rate constant (<i>k</i><sub>off</sub>). Binding free energy landscape (BFEL) constructor is a computational binding kinetics prediction method, previously developed by us, that estimates the binding kinetics for ligand-protein based on their constructed binding free energy landscape, but it also reveals the detailed molecular mechanism of the binding event, hence, providing the position of transition states at the molecular level to modify/improve the binding kinetics. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is a well-known Alzheimer's disease (AD) target for which there is still not an ideal drug on the market. Therefore, to improve the drug design strategy for AD, the binding kinetics and binding molecular mechanisms of the four inhibitors of AChE, that is, E2020 (Aricept), HupA, Rivastigmine, and Galantamine, were studied. Also, the differentiation of the binding kinetics between <i>m</i>AChE and <i>Tc</i>AChE was studied to evaluate the sensitiveness of BFEL constructor. The flexibility of molecules has a noticeable effect on the nature of BFEL. To the same target, flexible molecules (i.e., E2020 and Rivastigmine) which contain more rotatable bonds tend to have more complicated BFELs reflecting more complicated molecular action mechanisms than the rigid ones (i.e., HupA and Galantamine), which therefore could be more challenging to be optimized. The binding kinetics is highly dependent on the structure of the molecules, such as the length and the functional groups. Therefore, E2020 presents better binding kinetic and thermodynamic properties with either <i>Tc</i>AChE or <i>m</i>AChE. Therefore, it is the most promising lead drug for binding kinetics-based drug design. In addition, the binding kinetics of a drug may present different values in the proteins of different organisms because the residue compositions of the binding gorges of the targets are variant, that is, E2020 shows lower binding affinity and association energy barrier in binding with <i>m</i>AChE than <i>Tc</i>AChE.

AD and POAG have common symptoms, and therefore several common principles for their early diagnosis can be developed. Therefore, a promising direction is the search for biomarkers for the early detection of AD and POAG. Currently, the diagnosis of early AD biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid and biomarkers in the brain (imaging of amyloid plaques and tau positron emission tomography) are well studied, while data in literature on using these biomarkers in patients with POAG is scarce. However, the above diagnostic methods are not considered in routine clinical practice due to their invasiveness and high cost. There is a growing need for conventional, affordable biomarkers for AD and POAG, as it is necessary to start treatment of prodromal conditions from symptoms to onset of symptoms. In this connection, biomarkers such as A\u03b2 and tau protein in blood serum and plasma are actively evaluated in patients with AD.

The changes in amyloid pathology are accompanied by robust microglial and astrocytic hypertrophy, which suggest a protective glial response that may limit amyloid plaque development in G protein-biased GPR3 AD mice.

Besides its CNS stimulant properties, it is a mild inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and possesses memory-enhancing properties. The present work aimed to improve the AChE inhibition activity of the caffeine. The rationally designed caffeine-based triazoles were synthesized and evaluated in vitro for cholinesterase and \u03b2-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE-1) inhibitory activities. The attachment of triazole to the caffeine enhances its AChE inhibition activity from half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub> ) of 129 \u00b5M\u00a0to\u00a00.49\u2009\u00b5M (derivative, 6l). The caffeine core interacts with the peripheral anionic site, whereas the benzyl triazole occupies the catalytic anionic site located at the bottom of the active site gorge. The structure-activity relationship revealed that the four-atom ester linker is superior to shorter linkers for connecting the caffeine core to the triazole. The 2,6-difluorobenzyl triazole-linked caffeine derivative, 6d, exhibits dual inhibition of AChE and BACE-1 with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 1.43 and 10.9\u2009\u00b5M, respectively.

Thus, this study aimed to explore whether there are causal associations of genetically predicted PD and AD with IBD, using a two-sample MR study. Summary statistics for IBD, ulcerative colitis (UC), and Crohn's disease (CD) were derived from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis, which included the International IBD Genetics Consortium and the UK IBD Genetics Consortium (n=59,957). Genetic variants associated with the largest meta-analysis of GWAS of PD (n=1,474,097) and AD (n=455,258) were used as instrumental variables. We used multiple methods, including inverse variance weighted (IVW), weighted median (WM), MR-Egger regression, weighted mode, and Robust Adjusted Profile Score (RAPS) methods, to estimate the effects of genetically predicted PD and AD on IBD. To confirm the validity of the analysis, we also evaluated the pleiotropic effects, heterogeneity, and leave-one-out sensitivity analysis that drive causal associations.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow stresses provide the energy needed to induce molecular conformation changes leading to AD by initiating amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) and tau aggregation. Shear and extensional flow stresses initiate aggregation in the laboratory and in natural biophysical processes. Energy-rich CSF flow regions are mainly found in lower brain regions. MRI studies reveal flow stress &quot;hot spots&quot; in basal cisterns and brain ventricles that have chaotic flow properties that can distort molecules such as A\u03b2 and tau trapped in these regions into unusual conformations. Such fluid disturbance is surrounded by tissue deformation. There is strong mapping overlap between the locations of these hot spots and of early-stage AD pathology. Our mechanism creates pure and mixed protein dimers, followed by tissue surface adsorption, and long-term tissue agitation ultimately inducing chemical reactions forming more stable, toxic oligomer seeds that initiate AD. It is proposed that different flow stress energies and flow types in different basal brain regions produce different neurotoxic aggregates. Proliferating artery hardening is responsible for enhanced heart systolic pulses that drive energetic CSF pulses, whose critical maximum systolic pulse energy location migrates further from the heart with increasing vascular disease. Two glymphatic systems, carotid and basilar, are suggested to contain the earliest A\u03b2 and tau AD disease pathologies.

Impeding the formation of A\u03b2 \u03b2-structure-rich aggregates and dissociating A\u03b2 fibrils are considered potent strategies to suppress the onset and progression of AD. As a molecular chaperone, human \u03b1B-crystallin has received extensive attention in the inhibition of protein aggregation. Previous experiments reported that the structured core region of \u03b1B-crystallin (\u03b1BC) exhibits a better preventive effect on A\u03b2 aggregation and toxicity than the full-length protein. However, the molecular mechanism behind the effect of inhibition remains mostly unknown. Herein, we carried out six 500 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the inhibitory mechanism of \u03b1BC on A\u03b2<sub>42</sub> aggregation. Our simulations show that \u03b1BC greatly impedes the formation of \u03b2-structure contents.

However, the underlying sources of regional vulnerability to tau pathology remain unclear. Previous brain-autopsy findings suggest that the myelin levels-which differ substantially between white matter tracts in the brain-are a key modulating factor of region-specific susceptibility to tau deposition. Here, we investigated whether myelination differences between fiber tracts of the human connectome are predictive of the interregional spreading of tau pathology in AD. We included two independently recruited samples consisting of amyloid-PET-positive asymptomatic and symptomatic elderly individuals, in whom tau-PET was obtained at baseline (ADNI: n\u2009=\u2009275; BioFINDER-1: n\u2009=\u2009102) and longitudinally in a subset (ADNI: n\u2009=\u2009123, mean FU\u2009=\u20091.53 [0.69-3.95] years; BioFINDER-1: n\u2009=\u200939, mean FU\u2009=\u20091.87 [1.21-2.78] years).

In\u00a0a spatial regression analysis, we first tested the association between cortical myelin and group-average tau-PET signal in the amyloid-positive and control groups. Secondly, employing a previously established approach of modeling tau-PET spreading based on functional connectivity between ROIs, we estimated in\u00a0a linear regression analysis, whether the level of fiber-tract myelin modulates the association between functional connectivity and longitudinal tau-PET spreading (i.e., covariance) between ROIs.

In AD, amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) plaque-associated microglia (PAM) display a clearly distinct phenotype compared to plaque-distant microglia (PCM), suggesting that these two microglia subtypes likely differently contribute to disease progression. So far, molecular characterization of PAM was performed indirectly using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) approaches or based on markers that are supposedly up-regulated in this microglia subpopulation. In this study based on a well-characterized AD mouse model, we combined cell-specific laser capture\u00a0microdissection and RNA-seq analysis to i) identify, without preconceived notions of the molecular and/or functional changes that would affect these cells, the genes and gene networks that are dysregulated in PAM or PCM at three critical stages of the disease, and ii) to investigate the potential contribution of both plaque-associated and plaque-distant microglia. First, we established that our approach allows selective isolation of microglia, while preserving spatial information and preventing transcriptome changes induced by classical purification approaches. Then, we identified, in PAM and PCM subpopulations, networks of co-deregulated genes and analyzed their potential functional roles in AD. Finally, we investigated the dynamics of microglia transcriptomic remodeling at early, intermediate and late stages of the disease\u00a0and validated select findings in postmortem human AD brain. Our comprehensive study provides useful transcriptomic information regarding the respective contribution of PAM and PCM across the A\u03b2 pathology progression.

It demonstrates that the proximity of microglia to A\u03b2-plaques dramatically alters the microglial transcriptome and reveals that these changes can have both positive and negative impacts on the surrounding cells. These opposing effects may be driven by local microglia heterogeneity also demonstrated by this study. Our approach leads to molecularly define the less well studied plaque-distant microglia. We show that plaque-distant microglia are not bystanders of the disease, although the transcriptomic changes are far less striking compared to what is observed in plaque-associated microglia.

Electrostatic interactions, including those between permanent and induced dipoles, affected side-chain properties, salt bridges, and solvent interactions. The FAD mutations resulted in shifts in the electronic structure and solvent accessibility at the central hydrophobic cluster and the hydrophobic C-terminal region. Using umbrella sampling, we found that the folding of the WT and E22 mutants is enthalpically driven, whereas the D23N mutant is entropically driven, arising from a different unfolding pathway and peptide-bond dipole response. Together, the unbiased, full-length, and umbrella sampling simulations of fragments reveal that the FAD mutations perturb nearby residues and others in hydrophobic regions to potentially alter solubility.

Application of NADESs (choline chloride-urea 1:2, a so-called Reline) allowed one to obtain the highest number of extracts having antioxidant potential in the radical scavenging and reducing assays. NADES-B (protonated by HCl L-proline-xylitol 5:1) was the only extractant from the studied solvents that isolated a specific fraction without chelating activity. Reline extract exhibited the highest acetylcholinesterase inhibition compared to NADES-B and NADES-C (protonated by H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> L-proline-xylitol 5:1) extracts, which showed no inhibition. The NADES extracts were observed to have higher tyrosinase inhibitory properties compared to extracts obtained by traditional organic solvents. Furthermore, the NADES extracts were relatively better inhibitors of the diabetic enzymes. These findings provided an interesting comparison in terms of total polyphenolic content yields, antioxidant and enzyme inhibitory properties (cholinesterase, amylase, glucosidase, and tyrosinase) between traditional solvent extracts and NADES extracts, used as an alternative. While the organic solvents showed better antioxidant activity, the NADES extracts were found to have some other improved properties, such as higher total phenolic content and enzyme-inhibiting properties, suggesting functional prospects for their use in phytonutrient extraction and fractionation.

Cytokine-induced neuroinflammation, such as the tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), appear to play a role in BBB dysfunction and contribute to the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by contributing to amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptide accumulation.

Most cases of AD are sporadic, and very few are inherited; the pathogenesis of sporadic AD is complex and remains to be elucidated. The asparaginyl endopeptidase (AEP) or legumain is the only recognized cysteine protease that specifically hydrolyzes peptide bonds after asparagine residues in mammals. The expression level of AEPs in healthy brains is far lower than that of peripheral organs. Recently, growing evidence has indicated that aging may upregulate and overactivate brain AEPs. The overactivation of AEPs drives the onset of AD through cleaving tau and amyloid precursor proteins (APP), and SET, an inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). The AEP-mediated cleavage of these peptides enhances amyloidosis, promotes tau hyperphosphorylation, and ultimately induces neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. Upregulated AEPs and related deleterious reactions constitute upstream events of amyloid/tau toxicity in the brain, and represent early pathological changes in AD. Thus, upregulated AEPs are an emerging drug target for disease modification and a potential biomarker for predicting preclinical AD. However, the presence of the blood-brain barrier greatly hinders establishing body-fluid-based methods to measure brain AEPs. Research on AEP-activity-based imaging probes and our recent work suggest that the live brain imaging of AEPs could be used to evaluate its predictive efficacy as an AD biomarker.

The individual level SNP-QT signals are high dimensional and typically have small effect sizes, making them hard to be detected and replicated. To overcome this limitation, this work proposes a new approach that identifies high-level imaging genetic associations through applying multigraph clustering to the SNP-QT association maps. Given an SNP set and a brain QT set, the association between each SNP and each QT is evaluated using a linear regression model. Based on the resulting SNP-QT association map, five SNP-SNP similarity networks (or graphs) are created using five different scoring functions, respectively. Multigraph clustering is applied to these networks to identify SNP clusters with similar association patterns with all the brain QTs. After that, functional annotation is performed for each identified SNP cluster and its corresponding brain association pattern. We applied this pipeline to an AD imaging genetic study, which yielded promising results. For example, in an association study between 54 AD SNPs and 116 amyloid QTs, we identified two SNP clusters with one responsible for amyloid beta clearances and the other regulating amyloid beta formation.

In the present study, we explored the impacts of PGC-1a on AD pathology and neurobehavioral dysfunction and its potential mechanisms with a particular focus on mitochondrial dynamics.

Next, we grouped individuals with mild cognitive impairment according to the model obtained in the AD groups. Finally, the clinical measures and brain structural characteristics were compared among the subtypes to assess their relationship with differences in the functional network. Individuals with AD were clustered into 4 subtypes reproducibly, which included those with 1) diffuse and mild functional connectivity disruption (subtype 1), 2) predominantly decreased connectivity in the default mode network accompanied by an increase in the prefrontal circuit (subtype 2), 3) predominantly decreased connectivity in the anterior cingulate cortex accompanied by an increase in prefrontal cortex connectivity (subtype 3), and 4) predominantly decreased connectivity in the basal ganglia accompanied by an increase in prefrontal cortex connectivity (subtype 4). In addition to these differences in functional connectivity, differences between the AD subtypes were found in cognition, structural measures, and cognitive decline patterns.

Twelve years of stakeholder evaluations were analyzed. Rating scale data were summarized with descriptive statistics; open-ended questions were analyzed using an inductive thematic analysis. A thematic analysis was also used to analyze interviews with RaDAR researchers. Rating scale data showed high stakeholder satisfaction with all aspects of the Summit. Five themes were identified in the qualitative data: hearing diverse perspectives, building connections, collaborating for change, developing research and practice capacity, and leaving recharged. Five themes were identified in the researcher data: impact on development as a researcher, understanding stakeholder needs, informing research design, deepening commitment to rural dementia research, and building a culture of engagement. These findings reflect the key principles and impacts of stakeholder engagement reported in the literature. Additional findings include the value stakeholders place on connecting with stakeholders from diverse backgrounds, how the Summit was revitalizing, and how it developed stakeholder capacity to support change in their communities. Findings indicate that the Summit has developed into a community of practice where people with a common interest come together to learn and collaborate to improve rural dementia care.

We uncovered cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) as a novel regulator of DAT-mediated lysosome biogenesis and identified six novel CDK9-phosphorylated sites on TFEB. We observed that signal transduction by the DAT-CDK9-TFEB axis occurs on lysosomes. Finally, we found that LH2-051 enhanced the degradation of amyloid beta plaques and improved the memory of amyloid precursor protein (APP)/Presenilin 1 (PS1) mice. We identified the DAT-CDK9-TFEB signaling axis as a novel regulator of lysosome biogenesis.

Our lab previously reported that caspase-2 protein levels are elevated in these diseases, leading us to hypothesize that elevated caspase-2 protein levels are due to increased transcription of caspase-2 mRNA. There are two major isoforms of caspase-2 mRNA, caspase-2L and caspase-2S. We tested our hypothesis by measuring the levels of these mRNA isoforms normalized to levels of RPL13 mRNA, a reference gene that showed no disease-associated changes. Here, we report no increases in caspase-2L mRNA levels in any of the three diseases studied, AD (with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)), HD and LBD, disproving our hypothesis. Caspase-2S mRNA showed a non-significant downward trend in AD. We also analyzed expression levels of SNAP25 and \u03b2III-tubulin mRNA. SNAP25 mRNA was significantly lower in AD and there were downward trends in MCI, LBD, and HD. \u03b2III-tubulin mRNA expression remained unchanged between disease groups and controls. These findings indicate that factors besides transcriptional regulation cause increases in caspase-2 protein levels. The reduction of SNAP25 mRNA expression suggests that presynaptic dysfunction contributes to cognitive deficits in neurodegeneration.", "query": "Alzheimer"}, "36129754": {"ArticleTitle": "Evaluating Web-Based Automatic Transcription for Alzheimer Speech Data: Transcript Comparison and Machine Learning Analysis.", "AbstractText": "Speech data for medical research can be collected noninvasively and in large volumes. Speech analysis has shown promise in diagnosing neurodegenerative disease. To effectively leverage speech data, transcription is important, as there is valuable information contained in lexical content. Manual transcription, while highly accurate, limits the potential scalability and cost savings associated with language-based screening. To better understand the use of automatic transcription for classification of neurodegenerative disease, namely, Alzheimer disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or subjective memory complaints (SMC) versus healthy controls, we compared automatically generated transcripts against transcripts that went through manual correction. We recruited individuals from a memory clinic (&quot;patients&quot;) with a diagnosis of mild-to-moderate AD, (n=44, 30%), MCI (n=20, 13%), SMC (n=8, 5%), as well as healthy controls (n=77, 52%) living in the community. Participants were asked to describe a standardized picture, read a paragraph, and recall a pleasant life experience. We compared transcripts generated using Google speech-to-text software to manually verified transcripts by examining transcription confidence scores, transcription error rates, and machine learning classification accuracy. For the classification tasks, logistic regression, Gaussian naive Bayes, and random forests were used. The transcription software showed higher confidence scores (P&lt;.001) and lower error rates (P&gt;.05) for speech from healthy controls compared with patients. Classification models using human-verified transcripts significantly (P&lt;.001) outperformed automatically generated transcript models for both spontaneous speech tasks. This comparison showed no difference in the reading task. Manually adding pauses to transcripts had no impact on classification performance. However, manually correcting both spontaneous speech tasks led to significantly higher performances in the machine learning models. We found that automatically transcribed speech data could be used to distinguish patients with a diagnosis of AD, MCI, or SMC from controls. We recommend a human verification step to improve the performance of automatic transcripts, especially for spontaneous tasks. Moreover, human verification can focus on correcting errors and adding punctuation to transcripts. However, manual addition of pauses is not needed, which can simplify the human verification step to more efficiently process large volumes of speech data.", "query": "Alzheimer"}, "36129703": {"ArticleTitle": "Development of the Basel Version of the Awareness of Social Inference Test - Theory of Mind (BASIT-ToM) in healthy adults.", "AbstractText": "Impairments of Theory of Mind (ToM) abilities occur in a wide range of brain disorders.

The potential anti-inflammatory effect of new tricyclic 1,2-thiazine derivatives\u00a0(TP1, TP4, TP5, TP6, TP7, TP8, TP9, TP10) was assessed in SH-SY5Y cells differentiated to the neuron-like phenotype incubated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (5 or 50\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) or THP-1 microglial cell culture supernatant using MTT, DCF-DA, Griess, and fast halo (FHA) assays. Additionally, for cultures preincubated with 50\u00a0\u00b5g/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a cyclooxygenase (COX) activity assay was performed. Finally, the potential ability of tested compounds to cross the BBB was evaluated by computational studies. Molecular docking was performed with the TLR4/MD-2 complex to assess the possibility of binding the tested compounds in the LPS binding pocket. Prediction of ADMET parameters (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity) was also conducted. The unfavorable effect of LPS and co-culture with THP-1 cells on neuronal cell viability was counteracted with TP1 and TP4 in all tested concentrations. Tested compounds reduced the oxidative and nitrosative stress induced by both LPS and microglia activation and also reduced DNA damage. Furthermore, new derivatives inhibited total COX activity. Additionally, new compounds would cross the BBB with high probability and reach concentrations in the brain not lower than in the serum. The binding affinity at the TLR4/MD-2 complex binding site of TP4 and TP8 compounds is similar to that of the drug donepezil used in Alzheimer's disease. The ADMET analysis showed that the tested compounds should not be toxic and should show high intestinal absorption.

To date, there is little evidence on whether gait is altered in cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). We aimed to identify impairments in gait performance and associations between gait impairment and neuroimaging markers of CAA, cognition, and falls. Methods and Results Gait was assessed using the Zeno Walkway during preferred pace and dual task walks, and grouped into gait domains (Rhythm, Pace, Postural Control, and Variability). Participants underwent neuropsychological testing and neuroimaging. Falls and fear of falling were assessed through self-report questionnaires. Gait domain scores were standardized and analyzed using linear regression adjusting for age, sex, height, and other covariates. Participants were patients with CAA (n=29), Alzheimer disease with mild dementia (n=16), mild cognitive impairment (n=24), and normal elderly controls (n=47). CAA and Alzheimer disease had similarly impaired Rhythm, Pace, and Variability, and higher dual task cost than normal controls or mild cognitive impairment. Higher Pace score was associated with better global cognition, processing speed, and memory. Gait measures were not correlated with microbleed count or white matter hyperintensity volume. Number of falls was not associated with gait domain scores, but participants with low fear of falling had higher Pace (odds ratio [OR], 2.61 [95% CI, 1.59-4.29]) and lower Variability (OR, 1.64 [95% CI, 1.10-2.44]).

Due to the combined features of superhydrophilicity, flexibility, highly dense metal binding sites, large surface area and excellent size-exclusion effect, the fabricated nanocomposite G@mSiO<sub>2</sub>@PEI-PFIL-Ti<sup>4+</sup> exhibits superior detection sensitivity to enrich phosphopeptides (tryptic \u03b2-casein digest, 0.1 fmol), and extraordinary enrichment specificity to enrich phosphopeptides from a digest mixture of \u03b2-casein and bovine serum albumin (BSA) (molar ratio, 1\u2009:\u200912\u2009000). The excellent size-exclusion effect was also observed, and 27 endogenous phosphopeptides were identified in human saliva. All these results could be attributed to the unique superhydrophilic nanocomposite structure with a high density of a cationic linker modified with phosphonate functionality. Moreover, G@mSiO<sub>2</sub>@PEI-PFIL-Ti<sup>4+</sup> adsorbents were used to extract phosphopeptides from the tryptic digests of hippocampal lysates for quantitative phosphoproteome analysis. The preliminary results indicate that 1649 phosphoproteins, 3286 phosphopeptides and 4075 phosphorylation sites were identified. A total of 13 Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related phosphopeptides within tau proteins were detected with a wide coverage from p-Thr111 to p-Ser404, in which the amounts of some phoshopeptides at certain sites in AD transgenic mice were found statistically higher than those in wild type littermates. Besides, phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chains, a potential biomarker for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and traumatic brain injury, were also identified. Finally, the adsorbent was applied to human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood samples. 5 unique phosphopeptides of neuroendocrine specific VGF were identified in the CSF, while many phosphopeptides originated from the nervous system were found in the blood sample.

In all mouse and human synaptosomal preparations, tau release was inhibited by the selective metabotropic glutamate receptor 2/3 (mGluR2/3) agonist LY379268, an effect prevented by the selective mGlu2/3 antagonist LY341495. LY379268 was also able to block pathologic tau propagation between primary neurons in an in vitro microfluidic cellular model.

The performance of the downstream task generally improves when these latent representations are explicitly associated with factors of interest. For example, we derived such a representation for capturing brain aging by applying self-supervised learning to longitudinal MRIs and then used the resulting encoding to automatically identify diseases accelerating the aging of the brain. We now propose a refinement of this representation by replacing the linear modeling of brain aging with one that is consistent in local neighborhoods in the latent space. Called Longitudinal Neighborhood Embedding (LNE), we derive an encoding so that neighborhoods are age-consistent (i.e., brain MRIs of different subjects with similar brain ages are in close proximity of each other) and progression-consistent, i.e., the latent space is defined by a smooth trajectory field where each trajectory captures changes in brain ages between a pair of MRIs extracted from a longitudinal sequence. To make the problem computationally tractable, we further propose a strategy for mini-batch sampling so that the resulting local neighborhoods accurately approximate the ones that would be defined based on the whole cohort. We evaluate LNE on three different downstream tasks: (1) to predict chronological age from T1-w MRI of 274 healthy subjects participating in a study at SRI International; (2) to distinguish Normal Control (NC) from Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and stable Mild Cognitive Impairment (sMCI) from progressive Mild Cognitive Impairment (pMCI) based on T1-w MRI of 632 participants of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI); and (3) to distinguish no-to-low from moderate-to-heavy alcohol drinkers based on fractional anisotropy derived from diffusion tensor MRIs of 764 adolescents recruited by the National Consortium on Alcohol and NeuroDevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA). Across the three data sets, the visualization of the smooth trajectory vector fields and superior accuracy on downstream tasks demonstrate the strength of the proposed method over existing self-supervised methods in extracting information related to brain aging, which could help study the impact of substance use and neurodegenerative disorders.

However, the linearity of the fixed-effect structure in these models largely restrict their use to estimating treatment effects that are defined as linear combinations of effects on the outcome scale. In some situations, alternative quantifications of treatment effects may be more appropriate. In progressive diseases, for example, one may want to estimate if a drug has cumulative effects resulting in increasing efficacy over time or whether it slows the time progression of disease. This article introduces a class of nonlinear mixed-effects models called progression models for repeated measures (PMRMs) that, based on a continuous-time extension of the categorical-time parametrization of MMRMs, enables estimation of novel types of treatment effects, including measures of slowing or delay of the time progression of disease. Compared to conventional estimates of treatment effects where the unit matches that of the outcome scale (eg, 2 points benefit on a cognitive scale), the time-based treatment effects can offer better interpretability and clinical meaningfulness (eg, 6\u00a0months delay in progression of cognitive decline). The PMRM class includes conventionally used MMRMs and related models for longitudinal data analysis, as well as variants of previously proposed disease progression models as special cases. The potential of the PMRM framework is illustrated using both simulated and historical data from clinical trials in Alzheimer's disease with different types of artificially simulated treatment effects.

In the present study, we investigated the role of 77G7, a monoclonal tau antibody to the microtubule-binding repeats, in repressing the seeding activity of proteopathic tau. We found that 77G7 had a higher affinity toward aggregated pathological tau fractions than un-aggregated tau derived from AD brain. 77G7 inhibited the internalization of tau aggregates by cells, blocked AD O-tau to capture normal tau, and to seed tau aggregation in vitro and in cultured cells.

We treated adult zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) with okadaic acid (OKA) to model AD and assessed the resulting behavioral and neurochemical changes. We then employed a latent learning paradigm to assess cognitive and motor function followed by neurochemical analysis with fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) at carbon fiber microelectrodes to measure the electrically stimulated dopamine release. The behavioral assay showed that OKA treatment caused fish to have lower motivation to reach the goal chamber, resulting in impeded learning and decreased locomotor activity compared to controls.

There is also growing evidence for the prominent role of DNA methylation (DNAm) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We studied sex-specific DNA methylation differences in the blood samples of AD subjects compared to cognitively normal subjects, by performing sex-specific meta-analyses of two large blood-based epigenome-wide association studies (ADNI and AIBL), which included DNA methylation data for a total of 1284 whole blood samples (632 females and 652 males). Within each dataset, we used two complementary analytical strategies, a sex-stratified analysis that examined methylation to AD associations in male and female samples separately, and a methylation-by-sex interaction analysis that compared the magnitude of these associations between different sexes. After adjusting for age, estimated immune cell type proportions, batch effects, and correcting for inflation, the inverse-variance fixed-effects meta-analysis model was used to identify the most consistent DNAm differences across datasets. In addition, we also evaluated the performance of the sex-specific methylation-based risk prediction models for AD diagnosis using an independent external dataset. In the sex-stratified analysis, we identified 2 CpGs, mapped to the PRRC2A and RPS8 genes, significantly associated with AD in females at a 5% false discovery rate, and an additional 25 significant CpGs (21 in females, 4 in males) at P-value &lt; 1\u00d710<sup>-5</sup>.

Our best-performing sex-specific methylation-based prediction model in females performed better than that for males and additionally included estimated cell-type proportions. The significant discriminatory classification of AD samples with our methylation-based prediction models demonstrates that sex-specific DNA methylation could be a predictive biomarker for AD.

The gas chromatography (GC) was used to determine the ability of PA to pass the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in rats after oral administration. The sporadic AD rat model was established by intracerebroventricularly (ICV) injection with streptozotocin (STZ). PA (25 and 50\u00a0mg/kg) was given to rat orally once daily for 42 consecutive days. Morris water maze (MWM) test was performed to determine the learning and memory functions of the STZ-induced AD rats. EX527, a silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) selective inhibitor, was used to investigate the involvement of SIRT1 in the anti-AD effects of PA in rats. PA could penetrate the BBB. MWM test results showed that PA could significantly ameliorate the learning and memory deficits induced by STZ in rats. Meanwhile, PA enhanced the expression of SIRT1, and markedly alleviated the tau pathology by inhibiting the hyperacetylation (at the site of Lys174) and hyperphosphorylation (at the sites of Thr181, Thr205, Ser396 and Ser404) of tau protein. PA also efficiently suppressed the activation of microglia and astrocytes, and the beta-amyloid (A\u03b2) expression and the deacetylation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) at Lys 310 (K310) in the STZ-treated AD rats.

This study reported for the first time that PA could penetrate the BBB to exert its protective effects on the brain after a single-dose oral administration. The current experimental findings also amply demonstrated that PA could improve the cognitive and memory impairments in the STZ-induced AD rat model.

We performed a nested case-control study based on several national registers in Sweden. Cases were individuals newly diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) during 1970 to 2016 in Sweden, identified from the National Patient Register.

These disorders are characterized by the gradual loss of a selectively vulnerable group of neurons. Due to the complex pathophysiological mechanisms behind neurodegeneration and despite enormous efforts and understanding of the occurrence and progression of NDs, there is still a lack of an effective treatment for such diseases. Therefore, the development of a new therapeutic strategy for NDs is an unmet clinical need. Various natural compounds extracted from medicinal plants or fruits have shown promising activities in treating different types of NDs by targeting multiple signaling pathways. Among natural entities, flavonoids have incited a rise in public and scientific interest in recent years because of their purported health-promoting effects. Dietary supplementation of flavonoids has been shown to mitigate the severity of NDs such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and dementia by their antioxidant effects. Naringenin is a citrus flavonoid that is known to possess numerous biological activities like antioxidant, anti-proliferative, and anti-inflammatory activities. Therefore, naringenin has emerged as a potential therapeutic agent that exerts preventive and curative effects on several neurological disorders. Increasing evidence has attained special attention on the variety of therapeutic targets along with complex signaling pathways of naringenin, which suggest its possible therapeutic applications in several NDs. Derived from the results of several pre-clinical research and considering the therapeutic effects of this compound, this review focuses on the potential role of naringenin as a pharmacological agent for the treatment and management of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. The overall neuroprotective effects and different possible underlying mechanisms related to naringenin are discussed. In the light of substantial evidence for naringenin's neuroprotective efficacy in several experimental paradigms, this review suggests that this molecule should be investigated further as a viable candidate for the management of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, with an emphasis on mechanistic and clinical trials to determine its efficacy. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Naringenin is a flavanone, aglycone of Naringin, predominantly found in citrus fruits with a variety of pharmacological actions. Naringenin has been shown to exhibit remarkable therapeutic efficacy and has emerged as a potential therapeutic agent for the management of a variety of diseases such as various heart, liver, and metabolic disorders. Similarly, it has shown efficacy in neurodegenerative illnesses. Therefore, this review enables us to better understand the neuroprotective effects and different possible underlying mechanisms of naringenin. Also, this review provides a new indication to manage the symptoms of NDs like AD and PD.

Derivation of the pharmacophoric pattern from molecules that interacted with the AChE enzyme resulted in 3 pharmacophoric regions: an aromatic ring, an electron-acceptor region and a hydrophobic region. The molecules showed good pharmacokinetic and toxicological results, showing no warnings of mutagenicity and/or carcinogenicity.

In cellular and animal AD models and human AD brains, the APP intracellular domain fragment inhibits CHCHD6 transcription by binding its promoter. CHCHD6 and APP bind and stabilize one another. Reduced CHCHD6 enhances APP accumulation on mitochondria-associated ER membranes and accelerates APP processing, and induces mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal cholesterol accumulation, promoting amyloid pathology.

Secretase processing of mutant BRI2 leads to secretion and deposition of BRI2-derived amyloidogenic peptides, ABri and ADan that resemble APP/\u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) pathology, which is characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid pathology in FBD/FDD manifests itself predominantly in the microvasculature by ABri/ADan containing cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). While ABri and ADan peptide sequences differ only in a few C-terminal amino acids, CAA in FDD is characterized by co-aggregation of ADan with A\u03b2, while in contrast no A\u03b2 deposition is observed in FBD. The fact that FDD patients display an earlier and more severe disease onset than FBD suggests a potential role of ADan and A\u03b2 co-aggregation that promotes a more rapid disease progression in FDD compared to FBD. It is therefore critical to delineate the chemical signatures of amyloid aggregation in these two vascular dementias. This in turn will increase the knowledge on the pathophysiology of these diseases and the pathogenic role of heterogenous amyloid peptide interactions and deposition, respectively. Herein, we used matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) in combination with hyperspectral, confocal microscopy based on luminescent conjugated oligothiophene probes (LCO) to delineate the structural traits and associated amyloid peptide patterns of single CAA in postmortem brain tissue of patients with FBD, FDD as well as sporadic CAA without AD (CAA+) that show pronounced CAA without parenchymal plaques. The results show that CAA in both FBD and FDD consist of N-terminally truncated- and pyroglutamate-modified amyloid peptide species (ADan and ABri), but that ADan peptides in FDD are also extensively C-terminally truncated as compared to ABri in FBD, which contributes to hydrophobicity of ADan species. Further, CAA in FDD showed co-deposition with A\u03b2 x-42 and A\u03b2 x-40 species. CAA+ vessels were structurally more mature than FDD/FBD CAA and contained significant amounts of pyroglutamated A\u03b2. When compared with FDD, A\u03b2 in CAA+ showed more C-terminal and less N-terminally truncations. In FDD, ADan showed spatial co-localization with A\u03b23pE-40 and A\u03b23-40 but not with A\u03b2x-42 species. This suggests an increased aggregation propensity of A\u03b2 in FDD that promotes co-aggregation of both A\u03b2 and ADan. Further, CAA maturity appears to be mainly governed by A\u03b2 content based on the significantly higher 500/580 patterns observed in CAA+ than in FDD and FBD, respectively. Together this is the first study of its kind on comprehensive delineation of Bri2 and APP-derived amyloid peptides in single vascular plaques in both FDD/FBD and sporadic CAA that provides new insight in non-AD-related vascular amyloid pathology.

Immunosuppressive drugs derived from clinical protocols are frequently used but are often inconsistent and associated with toxic side effects. Here, using a molecular imaging approach, we show that immunosuppression targeting costimulatory molecules CD4 and CD40L enables robust survival of human xenografts in mouse brain, as compared to conventional tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil. Human neural stem cells were modified to express green fluorescent protein and firefly luciferase. Cells were implanted in the fimbria fornix of the hippocampus and viability assessed by non-invasive bioluminescent imaging. Cell survival was assessed using traditional pharmacologic immunosuppression as compared to monoclonal antibodies directed against CD4 and CD40L. This paradigm was also implemented in a transgenic Alzheimer's disease mouse model. Graft rejection occurs within 7 days in non-immunosuppressed mice and within 14 days in mice on a traditional regimen.

The few preclinical studies on this topic have only compared two subtypes of one antibody each and have yielded conflicting results. We selected two single domain antibodies (sdAbs) derived from a llama immunized with tau proteins and utilized them to generate an array of Fc-(sdAb)<sub>2</sub> subclasses containing identical tau binding domains but differing Fc region. Unmodified sdAbs and their IgG subclasses were tested for efficacy in primary cultures and in vivo microdialysis using JNPL3 tauopathy mice.

To evaluate the association between BMI and AD risk, the underweight population was further subdivided according to the degree of thinness. During the 10-year follow-up period, 22,279 individuals developed AD. Relative to the normal-weight population, the estimated adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for incident AD in the underweight, overweight, and obese populations was 1.17 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09-1.24), 0.90 (0.87-0.93), and 0.83 (0.80-0.85), respectively. In the underweight population, AD risk increased as the degree of thinness increased (p for the trend,\u2009&lt;\u2009.001).

While astrocytes contribute to both pathologic mechanisms, the role of their mitochondria, which is essential for signaling and maintenance of these processes, has been largely understudied. The current work provides the first direct evidence that the mitochondrial metabolic switch 17\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 10 (17\u03b2HSD10) is expressed and active in murine astrocytes from different brain regions. While it is known that this protein is overexpressed in the brains of AD patients, we found that 17\u03b2HSD10 is also upregulated in astrocytes exposed to amyloidogenic and ischemic stress. Importantly, such catalytic overexpression of 17\u03b2HSD10 inhibits mitochondrial respiration during increased energy demand. This observation contrasts with what has been found in neuronal and cancer model systems, which suggests astrocyte-specific mechanisms mediated by the protein. Furthermore, the catalytic upregulation of the enzyme exacerbates astrocytic damage, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and mitochondrial network alterations during amyloidogenic stress. On the other hand, 17\u03b2HSD10 inhibition through AG18051 counters most of these effects.

Here, we aimed to non-invasively visualize age-dependent alterations of retinal vasculature assessing the potential for using changes in retinal vasculature as the biomarker for the early diagnosis of tauopathy. Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA), a non-invasive depth-resolved high-resolution imaging technique was used to visualize and quantify tauopathy-induced alterations of retinal vasculature in P301S transgenic mice overexpressing the P301S mutant form of human tau and age-matched wild type littermate mice at 3, 6 and 10 months of age. We observed significant alterations of vascular features in the intermediate capillary plexus (ICP) and deep capillary plexus (DCP) but not in the superficial vascular complex (SVC) of P301S mice at early stages of tauopathy. With aging, alterations of vascular features in P301S mice became more prominent in all three vascular plexuses. Staining of retinal vasculature in flatmounts and trypsin digests of P301S mice at 10 months of age revealed decreased vessel density and increased acellular capillary formation, indicating that vascular degeneration also occurs during tauopathy. Overall, our results demonstrate that the changes in retinal vascular features accelerate during the progression of tauopathy.

We aimed to investigate the feasibility of a 24-week home-based intervention program using the Constant Therapy app and its preliminary efficacy on cognition in patients with AD. Constant Therapy is a program developed for patients with speech and cognitive deficits. We hypothesized that patients with AD would use Constant Therapy daily over the course of the 24-week period.

Participants were randomly assigned to either the Constant Therapy (n=10) or active control (n=9) group. The Constant Therapy group completed a tablet-based training during the first 24 weeks; the second 24 weeks of computerized training were optional. The active control group completed paper-and-pencil games during the first 24 weeks and were invited to complete an optional Constant Therapy training during the second 24 weeks. Every 6 weeks, the participants completed the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS). The participants independently accessed Constant Therapy using an Apple iPad. Our primary feasibility outcomes were the rate of adherence and daily use of Constant Therapy over 24 weeks. Our secondary outcomes were Constant Therapy performance over 24 weeks and change in RBANS scores between the 2 experimental groups. Feasibility analyses were computed for participants who completed 24 weeks of Constant Therapy. We found that long-term use of the Constant Therapy program was feasible in patients with AD over 24 weeks (adherence 80%; program use 121/168 days, for 32 minutes daily). These participants showed an overall improvement in accuracy and latency (P=.005) in the Constant Therapy scores, as well as specific improvements in visual and auditory memory, attention, and arithmetic tasks.

From this perspective, diving deeper into the particularities of the parietal lobe is of paramount importance. In this article, we discuss the functions of the parietal lobe, review the parietal anatomical and pathophysiological peculiarities in AD, and also describe some of the changes in the parietal region that occur after VI. Although the alterations in the hippocampus and the temporal lobe have been well documented in AD, the alterations of the parietal lobe have been less thoroughly explored. Recent neuroimaging studies have revealed that some metabolic and perfusion impairments along with a reduction of the white and grey matter could take place in the parietal lobe during AD. Conversely, it has been speculated that blinding ocular diseases induce a remodeling of the parietal region which is observable through the improvement of the integration of multimodal stimuli and in the increase of the volume of this cortical region. Based on current findings concerning the parietal lobe in both pathologies, we hypothesize that the increased activity of the parietal lobe in people with VI may diminish the neurodegeneration of this brain region in those who are visually impaired by oculardiseases.", "query": "Alzheimer"}, "36093697": {"ArticleTitle": "Hyperorality in Frontotemporal Dementia: Cognitive and Psychiatric Symptom Profiles in Early-Stage Disease.", "AbstractText": "Hyperorality is a distinctive feature of the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), but little is known about its significance in early-stage disease.

In this context, the aim of this study was to verify the effects of a multicomponent exercise program on physical fitness and cognitive function in the elderly with mild cognitive impairment and determine the role of oxidative stress and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). At baseline, 37 elderly nursing home residents with mild cognitive impairment were divided into two groups: the control group (CG, <i>n</i> = 12, 81.8 years) and the experimental group (EG, <i>n</i> = 25, 83.2 years).

This virus can invade human cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor-based mechanisms, affecting the human respiratory tract. However, several reports of neurological symptoms suggest a neuroinvasive development of coronavirus. SARS-CoV-2 can damage the brain via several routes, along with direct neural cell infection with the coronavirus. The chronic inflammatory reactions surge the brain with proinflammatory elements, damaging the neural cells, causing brain ischemia associated with other health issues. SARS-CoV-2 exhibited neuropsychiatric and neurological manifestations, including cognitive impairment, depression, dizziness, delirium, and disturbed sleep. These symptoms show nervous tissue damage that enhances the occurrence of neurodegenerative disorders and aids dementia. SARS-CoV-2 has been seen in brain necropsy and isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of COVID-19 patients. The associated inflammatory reaction in some COVID-19 patients has increased proinflammatory cytokines, which have been investigated as a prognostic factor. Therefore, the immunogenic changes observed in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's patients include their pathogenetic role. Inflammatory events have been an important pathophysiological feature of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. The neuroinflammation observed in AD has exacerbated the A<i>\u03b2</i> burden and tau hyperphosphorylation. The resident microglia and other immune cells are responsible for the enhanced burden of A<i>\u03b2</i> and subsequently mediate tau phosphorylation and ultimately disease progression.

Quantifying longitudinal changes in an individual's BAG temporal pattern would likely improve prediction of AD progression and clinical outcome based on neurophysiological changes.

In this sense, autophagy is a promising cellular process to remove these protein aggregates. This study evaluated the autophagy mechanisms involved in neuroprotection induced by 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2) in a Tet-On inducible expression tauopathy cell model (EGFP-tau WT or with the P301L mutation, 0N4R isoform). The results indicated that 17\u03b2-estradiol induces autophagy by activating AMPK in a concentration-dependent manner, independent of mTOR signals. The estrogen receptor \u03b1 (ER\u03b1) agonist, PPT, also induced autophagy, while the ER\u03b1 antagonist, MPP, substantially attenuated the 17\u03b2-estradiol-mediated autophagy induction.

Proteostasis is fundamental to preserve physiological metabolic processes in the cell and it allow to respond to any given stimulus as the expression of components of the proteostasis network is customized according to the proteomic demands of different cellular environments. In conditions that promote unfolding/misfolding of proteins chaperones act as signaling molecules inducing extreme measures to either fix the problem or destroy unfolded proteins. When the chaperone machinery fails under pathological insults unfolded proteins induce the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress activating the unfolded protein response (UPR) machinery. The activation of the UPR restores ER proteostasis primarily through the transcriptional remodeling of ER protein folding, trafficking, and degradation pathways, such as the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS). If these mechanisms do not manage to clear the aberrant proteins, proteasome overload and become defective, and misfolded proteins may form aggregates thus extending the UPR mechanism. These aggregates are then attempted to be cleared by macroautophagy. Impaired proteostasis promote the accumulation of misfolded proteins that exacerbate the damage to chaperones, surveillance systems and/or degradative activities. Remarkably, the removal of toxic misfolded proteins is critical for all cells, but it is especially significant in neurons since these cannot be readily replaced. In neurons, the maintenance of efficient proteostasis is essential to healthy aging since the dysregulation of the proteostasis network can lead to neurodegenerative disease. Each of these brain pathologies is characterized by the repeated misfolding of one of more peculiar proteins, which evade both the protein folding machinery and cellular degradation mechanisms and begins to form aggregates that nucleate out into large fibrillar aggregates.

CL is a training strategy of the networks that tries to mimic the way humans, in this case doctors, learn. Several CL strategies were implemented and compared to commonly used baseline methods. The results show that they improve the performance, particularly that of MCI.

Data from a neuroimaging cohort (n = 251 from OASIS-3) of early-stage AD dementia and healthy controls (HC) were analysed. The MR scans were initially fed to a pre-trained DL model, which achieved good performance on the test set (AUC: 0.82, TPR: 0.78, TNR: 0.81). Results were then investigated by means of an XAI approach (Occlusion Sensitivity method) that provided measures of relevance (RV) as outcome. We compared RV values obtained within healthy tissues with those underlying white matter hyperintensity (WMH) lesions. The analysis was conducted on 4 different groups of data, obtained by stratifying correct and misclassified images according to the health condition of participants (AD/HC).

In this work, we built on previous cost-sensitive feature selection approaches by generalising to multiple cost types, while taking into consideration that stakeholders attempting to optimise the dementia care pathway might face multiple non-fungible budget constraints. Our new optimisation algorithm involved the searching of cost-weighting hyperparameters while constrained by total budgets. We then provided a proof of concept using both assessment time cost and financial budget cost. We showed that budget constraints could control the feature selection process in an intuitive and practical manner, while adjusting the hyperparameter increased the range of solutions selected by feature selection. We further showed that our budget-constrained cost optimisation framework could be implemented in a user-friendly graphical user interface sandbox tool to encourage non-technical users and stakeholders to adopt and to further explore and audit the model - a humans-in-the-loop approach. Overall, we suggest that setting budget constraints initially and then fine tuning the cost-weighting hyperparameters can be an effective way to perform feature selection where multiple cost constraints exist, which will in turn lead to more realistic optimising and redesigning of dementia diagnostic assessments.

There is no superiority of serious games over no or passive interventions and conventional exercises in improving processing speed among older adults with cognitive impairment. However, our findings remain inconclusive because of the low quality of the evidence, the small sample size in most of the included studies, and the paucity of studies included in the meta-analyses. Therefore, until more robust evidence is published, serious games should be offered or used as an adjunct to existing interventions. Further trials should be undertaken to investigate the effect of serious games that specifically target processing speed rather than cognitive abilities in general.

Additional studies of human brains revealed that P-tau231 was mainly expressed in the temporal cortex in MSA brains and that its expression level was significantly higher in MSA patients than in controls. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that anti-P-tau231-, but not AT8, antibodies mainly immunolabeled hippocampal CA2/3 pyramidal neurons, and some GCIs in MSA.

The combination approach may even allow for providing individual agents in lower doses, with reducible cost and side effects.

Cholesterol, an important component of membranes, is well-recognized as a risk factor in AD. It can affect the aggregation and pore formation of A\u03b2 on membranes whereas the specific effects are rather complex, particularly regarding the non-linear response to cholesterol concentrations. Yet, the mechanistic understanding of the role of cholesterol in A\u03b2-membrane interactions remains incomplete. Herein, we employed microsecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the effects of cholesterol on A\u03b2 dimerization in a lipid bilayer containing different molar ratios of cholesterol (0, 20, and 40 mol %). Cholesterol reduces the time required for the formation of stable dimers and exerts dual effects on A\u03b2-membrane interactions. First, cholesterol promotes the extraction of the C-terminal region from the membrane to water. Consequently, at the ratios of 0 and 20 mol %, peptides are anchored at the membrane-water interface, but they are repelled to water at a ratio of 40 mol % with high structural flexibility. Second, cholesterol weakens A\u03b2-membrane interactions, thereby enhancing inter-peptide interactions. The former is favorable for dimerization while the latter is not. The balance between two factors eventually leads to a non-monotonic effect on the degree of dimerization, whereby the number of inter-peptide contacts is the largest at a cholesterol ratio of 20 mol %. These results provide atomistic insights into the regulation mechanism of A\u03b242 aggregation by cholesterol and help to understand the pathological link between cholesterol and AD.", "query": "Alzheimer"}, "36082494": {"ArticleTitle": "Inhibition of Alzheimer's A\u03b2<sub>1-42</sub> Fibrillogenesis and Removal of Copper Ions by Polypeptides Modified Gold Nanoparticles.", "AbstractText": "Aggregation and fibrillation of \u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\u03b2) as well as accumulation of toxic metal ions have been believed to be the central events to cause Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Mitochondrial noncoding RNA modifications and the post-translational modification of mitochondrial nucleoproteins have been observed in neurodegenerative diseases and related diseases that increase the risk of AD. Although there are still relatively few mitochondrial noncoding RNA modifications and mitochondrial nuclear protein post-translational modifications reported in AD, we have reason to believe that these mitochondrial epigenetic modifications also play an important role in the AD process. This review provides a new research direction for the AD mechanism, starting from mitochondrial epigenetics.

The effect of Cur or FA on A\u03b2 aggregation using thioflavin T assay was confirmed to be inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by Cur single or Cur + FA combination treatment. The effects of Cur + FA on the cytotoxicity of human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells induced by A\u03b2 exposure were an increase in cell viability, a decrease in ROS and mitochondrial ROS, and repair of membrane damage.
