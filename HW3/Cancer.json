We performed a systematic review and conducted a retrospective analysis of TB infection in patients with lung cancer and ICI exposure to assess the clinical characteristics and outcomes using PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. The time interval from ICI administration to diagnosis of TB between patients with and without a history of TB was compared using Kaplan-Meier analysis. A multivariate Cox regression model was used to identify potential risk factors associated with the time interval of TB development. Twenty-four studies including 53 patients with lung cancer were included. The median age of the patients was 64\u00a0years. Eight patients had a history of TB. The median time interval from ICI administration to TB diagnosis was 3\u00a0months. In retrospective analysis, 5 (1.16%, 95%CI 0.38% to 2.68%) patients with lung cancer developed TB during ICI treatment. The median time interval was 10.4\u00a0months. In a pooled analysis, the median time interval in the without-TB and with-TB groups was 7.00 and 2.35\u00a0months, respectively (P\u00a0=\u00a0.034). Multivariate Cox regression analyses revealed a history of TB to be an independent factor affecting the time interval of TB activation in patients with lung cancer and ICI exposure (HR\u00a03.59; 95%CI 1.17 to 11.02; P\u00a0=\u00a0.026). Therefore, TB infection should be considered in patients with lung cancer during or after ICI treatment. Moreover, we found TB history to be a positive risk factor for a shorter median time interval from ICI to TB diagnosis in patients with lung cancer receiving ICI.

Scientists have projected that by 2040, the prevalence will reach up to 3.2 million new cases annually due to population aging, disadvantageous diet transformations, and elevated exposure to risk factors. In the past decades, the five-year survival rate in colorectal cancer has significantly increased to 65% due to the development of an early endoscopic diagnosis and new chemotherapeutic approaches. Fluoropyrimidines, such as 5-fluorouracil or capecitabine, are commonly used to treat CRC. One of the most fundamental mechanisms of 5-FU is based on the inhibition of thymidylate synthase. This action is responsible for the therapeutic, but also toxic, effects of the drug. In this short review, we discuss the possible effects of vitamin D activity on colorectal cancer cells in relation to fluoropyrimidines. PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases were searched up to January 2022 for studies on vitamin D and 5-fluorouracil interaction mechanisms.

As MC simulations can be very time consuming for this kind of application, deep learning models have been considered to accelerate dose estimation in cancer patients. This work systematically evaluates the dose prediction accuracy, speed and generalisation performance of three selected state-of-the-art deep learning models for dose prediction applied to proton minibeam therapy. The strengths and weaknesses of those models are thoroughly investigated, helping other researchers to decide on a viable algorithm for their own\u00a0application. The following recently published models are compared: first, a 3D U-Net model trained as a regression network, second, a 3D U-Net trained as a generator of a generative adversarial network (GAN) and third, a dose transformer model which interprets the dose prediction as a sequence translation task. These models are trained to emulate the result of MC simulations. The dose depositions of a proton minibeam with a diameter of 800\u2009\u03bcm and an energy of 20-100 MeV inside a simple head phantom calculated by full Geant4 MC simulations are used as a case study for this comparison. The spatial resolution is 0.5 mm. Special attention is put on the evaluation of the generalisation performance of the investigated\u00a0models. Dose predictions with all models are produced in the order of a second on a GPU, the 3D U-Net models being fastest with an average of 130 ms. An investigated 3D U-Net regression model is found to show the strongest performance with overall 61.0\u00b10.5\\% of all voxels exhibiting a deviation in energy deposition prediction of less than 3\\% compared to full MC simulations with no spatial deviation allowed. The 3D U-Net models are observed to show better generalisation performance for target geometry variations while the transformer-based model shows better generalisation with regard to the proton\u00a0energy. This paper reveals that (1) all studied deep learning models are significantly faster than non-machine learning approaches predicting the dose in the order of seconds compared to hours for MC, (2) all models provide reasonable accuracy and (3) the regression-trained 3D U-Net provides the most accurate\u00a0predictions.

This study included all consecutive patients who underwent a colonic interposition between January 2015 and December 2021 at a tertiary referral center. Surgery was performed for the following indications: inability to use the stomach because of previous surgery or extensive tumour involvement, cancer recurrence in the gastric conduit, or because of complications after initial esophagectomy. Since 2018 ICG-FA was performed before anastomotic reconstruction by administration of ICG injection (0.1 mg/kg/bolus), using the Spy-phi (Stryker, Kalamazoo, MI). Twenty-eight patients (9 female, mean age 62.8), underwent colonic interposition of whom 15 (54%) underwent ICG-FA-guided surgery. Within the ICG-FA group, three (20%) AL occurred, whereas in the non-ICG-FA group, three AL and one graft necrosis (31%) occurred (P=0.67).

Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) can be recruited into osteosarcoma tissue and affect the progression by secreting exosomes. However, whether BMSCs derived exosomes transmit XIST to regulate the growth and metastasis of osteosarcoma and the related mechanism are still unclear. In this study, BMSCs derived exosomes were used to treat human osteosarcoma cells MG63 and 143B, and the level of XIST in BMSCs was intervened by siRNA. CCK-8, EdU, transwell assays were used to analyze the changes of cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Bioinformatics analysis, RNA pulldown and dual-luciferase reporter gene assays validated the targeted relationship of XIST with miR-655 and the interaction between miR-655 and ACLY 3'-UTR. 143B/LUC cell line was used to establish an animal model of in situ osteosarcoma to verify the found effects of XIST on osteosarcoma. Oil Red O staining, Western blot and so on were used to detect the changes of lipid deposition and protein expression. It was found that BMSCs derived exosomes promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion of osteosarcoma cells, and the down-regulation of XIST inhibited this effect. miR-655 mediated the role of BMSCs derived exosomal XIST in promoting the progression of osteosarcoma and down-regulation of miR-655 could reverse the effects of inhibiting XIST on the proliferation, migration and invasion of osteosarcoma cells. Meanwhile, animal level results confirmed that BMSCs derived exosomal XIST could promote osteosarcoma growth and lung metastasis by combining with miR-655.

Econometric methods have been used to estimate these in several countries based on data on spending and mortality. This study examines empirical evidence on four issues: non-linearity of the relationship between spending and mortality; the inclusion of outcomes other than mortality; variation in the efficiency with which expenditures generate health outcomes; and the relationship among efficiency, mortality rates and outcome elasticities. Quantile Regression is used to examine non-linearities in the relationship between mortality and health expenditures along the mortality distribution. Data Envelopment Analysis extends the approach, using multiple measures of health outcomes to measure efficiency. These are applied to health expenditure data from 151 geographical units (Primary Care Trusts) of the National Health Service in England, across eight different clinical areas (Programme Budget Categories), for 3 fiscal years from 2010/11 to 2012/13. The results suggest differences in efficiency levels across geographical units and clinical areas as to how health resources generate outcomes, which indicates the capacity to adjust to a decrease in health expenditure without affecting health outcomes. Moreover, efficient units have lower absolute levels of mortality elasticity to health expenditure than inefficient ones. The policy of adopting thresholds based on estimates of a single system-wide cost-effectiveness threshold assumes a relationship between expenditure and health outcomes that generates an opportunity cost estimate which applies to the whole system. Our evidence of variations in that relationship and therefore in opportunity costs suggests that adopting a single threshold may exacerbate the efficiency and equity concerns that such thresholds are designed to counter. In most health care systems, many decisions about provision are not made centrally. Our analytical approach to understanding variability in opportunity cost can help policy makers target efficiency improvements and set realistic targets for local and clinical area health improvements from increased expenditure.", "query": "Cancer"}, "36309678": {"ArticleTitle": "An exploratory assessment of the impact of a novel risk assessment test on breast cancer clinic waiting times and workflow: a discrete event simulation model.", "AbstractText": "Breast cancer clinics across the UK have long been struggling to cope with high demand. Novel risk prediction tools - such as the PinPoint test - could help to reduce unnecessary clinic referrals. Using early data on the expected accuracy of the test, we explore the potential impact of PinPoint on: (a) the percentage of patients meeting the two-week referral target, and (b) the number of clinic 'overspill' appointments generated (i.e. patients having to return to the clinic to complete their required investigations). A simulation model was built to reflect the annual flow of patients through a single UK clinic. Due to current uncertainty around the exact impact of PinPoint testing on standard care, two primary scenarios were assessed. Scenario 1 assumed complete GP adherence to testing, with only non-referred cancerous cases returning for delayed referral. Scenario 2 assumed GPs would overrule 20% of low-risk results, and that 10% of non-referred non-cancerous cases would also return for delayed referral. A range of sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the impact of key uncertainties on the model results. Service reconfiguration scenarios, removing individual weekly clinics from the clinic schedule, were also explored. Under standard care, 66.3% (95% CI: 66.0 to 66.5) of patients met the referral target, with 1,685 (1,648 to 1,722) overspill appointments. Under both PinPoint scenarios, &gt;\u200998% of patients met the referral target, with overspill appointments reduced to between 727 (707 to 746) [Scenario 1] and 886 (861 to 911) [Scenario 2].

The capability of migration and invasion was evaluated by wound healing assay and Boyden-chamber assay. The mRNA and protein expression of EMT markers was respectively detected by qPCR and western blot. We detected NRF2 occupancy at the miR-27a promoter by ChIP-Seq analysis. Meanwhile, the luciferase assay verified BUB1 as a direct target of miR-27a. We found hypoxia promotes lung cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process by inhibiting the miR-27a expression. miR-27a mimics significantly reduced the promotion effect of hypoxia on the invasion and proliferation of lung cancer cells. NRF2 as regulating the oxidation/anti-oxidation factor was activated under hypoxia conditions. The activation of NRF2 repressed miR-27a expression. On the contrary, the inhibitory effect of hypoxia on miR-27a was reversed when the NFE2L2 gene was silenced. Ectopic expression of NRF2 inhibited miR-27a expression under normoxia. We further validated BUB1 as a direct target of the miR-27a by luciferase assay.

The level of the STAMBP protein in noncancerous and tumor tissues of breast cancer patients was examined by immunohistochemical staining. The expression of STAMBP mRNA in tissues based on healthy individual and breast cancer patient data in the TCGA database was evaluated. The association between the expression of STAMBP mRNA and clinical features and prognosis was evaluated using TCGA database. Cell growth was assessed by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, and cell migration and invasion were assessed by wound healing and Transwell assays. Activation of the ERK signaling was detected by Western blotting. The expression of STAMBP was markedly upregulated in the cytoplasm of tumor cells from breast cancer patients. The level of STAMBP was closely associated with the tumor subtype and size and the TNM stage of the breast cancer patients. Importantly, high expression of STAMBP predicted poor overall survival (OS) for breast cancer patients. Furthermore, knockdown of STAMBP expression reduced cell mobility and invasion of breast cancer cells. Notably, the phosphorylation of EGFR and ERK was markedly reduced in STAMBP-knockdown cells.

The cytotoxic activity of Ketoprofen was assayed by the MTS method. Flowcytometry was utilized to measure the number of apoptotic MDA-MB-231 cells. The expression levels of apoptosis and autophagy markers, JAK2 and STAT3 were determined using quantitative real time-PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blotting methods. Ketoprofen significantly decreased the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells compared to control cells. It also considerably induced apoptosis and apoptotic markers in these cells in comparison to controls. Treating the MADA-MB-231 cell line with Ketoprofen had an inhibitory effect on autophagy markers in this cell line. The use of FasL, as a death ligand, and ZB4, as an antibody that blocks the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis, revealed the involvement of the extrinsic pathway in the apoptosis-stimulating effect of Ketoprofen in the MADA-MB-231 cell line. Ketoprofen also hindered the phosphorylation and activation of JAK2 and STAT molecules leading to the inhibition of the JAK/STAT pathway in this TNBC cell line.

Here, we show that GATA-4 recruits polycomb group proteins such as EZH2 to negatively regulate miR-29a in undifferentiated C2C12 myoblast cells, whereas recruitment of GRIP-1 to GATA-4 proteins displaces EZH2, resulting in the activation of miR-29a during myogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells. Moreover, in poorly differentiated rhabdomyosarcoma cells, EZH2 still binds to the miR-29a promoter with GATA-4 to mediate transcriptional repression of miR-29a. Interestingly, once re-differentiation of rhabdomyosarcoma cells toward skeletal muscle, EZH2 was dispelled from miR-29a promoter which is similar to that in myogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells. Eventually, this expression of miR-29a results in limited rhabdomyosarcoma cell proliferation and promotes myogenic differentiation. We thus establish that GATA-4 can function as a molecular switch in the up- and downregulation of miR-29a expression.

While patients with de novo CML-AP have outcomes almost similar to CML in chronic phase (CP), those transformed from previously treated CML-CP should receive second- or third- generation TKIs and be strongly considered for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). Similarly, patients with transformed CML-BP have particularly dismal outcomes with a median survival usually less than one year. Combination regimens with a potent TKI such as ponatinib followed by allo-SCT can achieve long-term survival in some transformed BP patients.

Multimodal profiling of the TME reveals that CaMKK2 is associated with several ICB resistance-associated immune phenotypes. CaMKK2 promotes exhaustion in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and reduces the expansion of effector CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, additionally limiting their tumor penetrance. CaMKK2 also maintains myeloid cells in a disease-associated microglia-like phenotype. Lastly, neuronal CaMKK2 is required for maintaining the ICB resistance-associated myeloid phenotype, is deleterious to survival, and promotes ICB resistance.

Although \u03b2-cell targeted autoimmune processes and \u03b2-cell dysfunction are known to occur in type 1 diabetes, a complete understanding of the cell-to-cell interactions that support pancreatic function is still lacking. To characterize the pancreatic endocrine compartment, we studied pancreata from healthy adult donors and investigated a single cell surface adhesion molecule, desmoglein-2 (DSG2). Genetically-modified mice lacking Dsg2 were examined for islet cell mass, insulin production, responses to glucose, susceptibility to a streptozotocin-induced mouse model of hyperglycaemia, and ability to cure diabetes in a syngeneic transplantation model. Herein, we have identified DSG2 as a previously unrecognized adhesion molecule that supports \u03b2-cells. Furthermore, we reveal that DSG2 is within the top 10 percent of all genes expressed by human pancreatic islets and is expressed by the insulin-producing \u03b2-cells but not the somatostatin-producing \u03b4-cells. In a Dsg2 loss-of-function mice (Dsg2<sup>lo/lo</sup>), we observed a significant reduction in the number of pancreatic islets and islet size, and consequently, there was less total insulin content per islet cluster. Dsg2<sup>lo/lo</sup> mice also exhibited a reduction in blood vessel barrier integrity, an increased incidence of streptozotocin-induced diabetes, and islets isolated from Dsg2<sup>lo/lo</sup> mice were more susceptible to cytokine-induced \u03b2-cell apoptosis. Following transplantation into diabetic mice, islets isolated from Dsg2<sup>lo/lo</sup> mice were less effective than their wildtype counterparts at curing diabetes. In vitro assays using the Beta-TC-6 murine \u03b2-cell line suggest that DSG2 supports the actin cytoskeleton as well as the release of cytokines and chemokines. Taken together, our study suggests that DSG2 is an under-appreciated regulator of \u03b2-cell function in pancreatic islets and that a better understanding of this adhesion molecule may provide new opportunities to combat type 1 diabetes.", "query": "Cancer"}, "36309485": {"ArticleTitle": "A novel BH3 mimetic Bcl-2 inhibitor promotes autophagic cell death and reduces in vivo Glioblastoma tumor growth.", "AbstractText": "Anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family proteins play central roles in the regulation of cell death in glioblastoma (GBM), the most malignant type of brain tumor.

Under this approach, the observed lifetime of each DoC patient is considered as an &quot;incomplete data&quot; and is extended by an additional expected lifetime computed using the classical Kaplan-Meier model. Sixteen patients were dead of disease (DoD), 1 patient was DoC and 77 cases were censored (Cen). The DoC patient died of Covid-19 52 months after diagnosis.

In the present study, we determined whether methionine restriction with oral recombinant methioninase (o-rMETase) would lower the effective dose of cisplatinum in a PDOX model of primary osteosarcoma of the mammary gland, thereby reducing its toxicity. Mouse PDOX models of primary osteosarcoma of the breast were randomized into the following groups: control; cisplatinum (weekly at 3 or 6 mg/kg); twice-daily o-rMETase; or o-rMETase combined with 3 mg/kg cisplatinum, with treatment for 2 weeks. Cisplatinum at 6 mg/kg significantly inhibited breast osteosarcoma growth compared with the untreated control and mice treated with 3 mg/kg cisplatinum (p=0.01 and 0.009, respectively). There was no significant difference in tumor growth between mice treated with cisplatinum at 3 mg/kg and the control (p=0.16).

Unlike previous efforts, modern immunotherapy is now a realistic and formidable therapeutic option for patients with relapsed/refractory malignancies. Unfortunately, most of the successes obtained thus far have primarily been in patients with hematologic malignancies.

Despite advances in the pharmacokinetic properties of DNMT inhibitors, the efficacy of these drugs in solid cancers remains low. Here, we show in cell lines and clinical and experimental tumors across multiple cancer types that DNMT inhibition induces the expression of interleukin-1 (IL-1), a cytokine with proinflammatory and protumorigenic properties. Specifically, this tumor-intrinsic IL-1 expression modulates the chemokine landscape of tumors and leads to the recruitment of monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells to the tumor microenvironment, processes that can be blocked by IL-1 antagonists. Molecular analysis demonstrates complex patterns of IL-1 and interferon activation and crosstalk in response to DNMT inhibition, which depend on the integrity of IRF- and NF-\u03baB-mediated antiviral pathways and may determine the outcome of DNMT-inhibitor treatment.

To define the immunomodulatory mechanisms of DCLK1 in vivo, we generated the DCLK1<sup>-/-</sup> tumor cells by CRIPSR-Cas9 and developed subcutaneous and intestinal orthotopic transplantation tumor models.

We found DCLK1<sup>-/-</sup> tumor cells lose their tumorigenicity under immune surveillance. Failed tumor establishment of DCLK1<sup>-/-</sup> was associated with an increase in infiltration of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and effector CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, and reduced numbers of MDSCs in the tumor tissue.

Our experimental model reproduced several aspects of the human NASH pathophysiology. NLRP3 inflammasome activation was induced by the combined effect of HFSCD plus CCl<sub>4</sub> and significantly increased levels of both proinflammatory and profibrogenic cytokines and collagen deposition in the liver; thus, NASH severity was higher in the HFSCD+CCl<sub>4</sub> group than that in the HFSCD group, to which CCl<sub>4</sub> was not administered.

SOX2 is a master TF of pluripotency and self-renewal of embryonic stem cells, and its dysregulation is also associated with various types of human cancers. A potential crosstalk between these TFs could be relevant in malignant cells yet, to the best of our knowledge, no formal study has been performed thus far. Here we show, by quantitative live-cell imaging microscopy, that ectopic expression of SOX2 disrupts the formation of hormone-dependent intranuclear condensates of many steroid receptors (SRs), including those formed by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). SOX2 also reduces GR's binding to specific DNA targets and modulates its transcriptional activity. SOX2-driven effects on GR condensates do not require the intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain of the receptor and, surprisingly, neither relies on GR/SOX2 interactions. SOX2 also alters the intranuclear dynamics and compartmentalization of the SR coactivator NCoA-2 and impairs GR/NCoA-2 interactions. These results suggest an indirect mechanism underlying SOX2-driven effects on SRs involving this coactivator. Together, these results highlight that the transcriptional program elicited by GR relies on its nuclear organization and is intimately linked to the distribution of other GR partners, such as the NCoA-2 coactivator. Abnormal expression of SOX2, commonly observed in many tumors, may alter the biological action of GR and, probably, other SRs as well.

Targeting non-junctional CLDN1 markedly suppressed tumor growth and invasion in cell line-based models of HCC and patient-derived 3D ex vivo models. Moreover, the robust effect on tumor growth was confirmed in vivo in a large series of cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models. Mechanistic studies including single-cell RNA sequencing of multicellular patient HCC tumorspheres suggested that CLDN1 regulates tumor stemness, metabolism, oncogenic signaling and perturbs the tumor immune microenvironment.

Here, we investigated a PARP1 PROTAC termed &quot;NN3&quot;, which triggered ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation of PARP1. Moreover, NN3 degraded PARP1 with resistance-related mutations. Interestingly, compared with other reported PARP1 degraders, NN3 exhibited a unique antitumor mechanism in p53-positive breast cancer cells that effectively promoted ferroptosis by downregulating the SLC7A11 pathway. Furthermore, NN3 showed potent activity and low toxicity in vivo. In conclusion, we propose PROTAC-mediated degradation of PARP1 as a novel strategy against mutation-related PARPi resistance and a paradigm for targeting breast cancer with functional p53 via ferroptosis induction.", "query": "Cancer"}, "36309079": {"ArticleTitle": "Oncogenic signaling of the Free-Fatty Acid Receptors FFA1 and FFA4 in human breast carcinoma cells.", "AbstractText": "Globally, breast cancer is the most frequent type of cancer in women, and most breast cancer-associated deaths are due to metastasis and recurrence of the disease. Dietary habits, specifically dietary fat intake is a crucial risk factor involved in breast cancer development and progression. Decades of research has revealed that free-fatty acids (FFA) modulate carcinogenic processes through fatty acid metabolism and lipid peroxidation. The ground-breaking discovery of free-fatty acid receptors, which are members of the G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) superfamily, has led to the realization FFA can also act via these receptors to modulate carcinogenic effects. The long-chain free-fatty acid receptors FFA1 (previously termed GPR40) and FFA4 (previously termed GPR120) are activated by mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids including \u03c9-3, 6, and 9 fatty acids. Initial enthusiasm towards the study of these receptors focused on their insulin secretagogue and sensitization effects, and the downstream associated metabolic regulation. However, recent studies have demonstrated that abnormal expression and/or aberrant FFA1/FFA4 signaling are evident in human breast carcinomas, suggesting that FFA receptors could be a promising target in the treatment of breast cancer. The current review discusses the diverse roles of FFA1 and FFA4 in the regulation of cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and chemotherapy resistance in human breast carcinoma cells and tissue.", "query": "Cancer"}, "36309077": {"ArticleTitle": "A Prospective Study of Mucosal Sparing Radiation Therapy in Resected Oropharyngeal Cancer Patients.", "AbstractText": "To report the prospective results of mucosal sparing radiation (MSRT) in HPV related OPSCC.

Our DL model uses a pair of cine MRI images as input and provides a motion vector field (MVF) as output. The MVF is then applied to align the input images. A retrospective study was conducted to train and evaluate our model using cine MRI data from patients undergoing treatment for abdominal and thoracic tumors. For each treatment fraction, MR-LINAC delivery log files, tracking videos, and cine DICOM files were analyzed. Individual MRI frames were temporally sampled to construct a large set of image registration pairs used to evaluate multiple methods. The DL model was optimized using five-fold cross validation, and model outputs (transformed images and MVFs) using test set images were saved for comparison with three conventional registration methods (affine, b-spline, and demons). Evaluation metrics were three-fold: 1) registration error, 2) MVF stability (both spatial and temporal), and 3) average computation time. We analyzed &gt;21 hours of cine MRI (&gt;629,000 frames) acquired during 86 treatment fractions from 21 patients.

Any such condition related to skin or brain sometimes advances in cancer and becomes a life-threatening disease. So, an efficient automatic image segmentation approach is required at the initial stage of medical image analysis. To make a segmentation process efficient and reliable, it is essential to use an appropriate objective function and an efficient optimization algorithm to produce optimal results. The above problem is resolved in this paper by introducing a new minimum generalized cross entropy (MGCE) as an objective function, with the inclusion of the degree of divergence. Another key contribution is the development of a new optimizer called opposition African vulture optimization algorithm (OAVOA). The proposed optimizer boosted the exploration, skill by inheriting the opposition-based learning. The experimental work in this study starts with a performance evaluation of the optimizer over a set of standards (23 numbers) and IEEE CEC14 (8 numbers) Benchmark functions. The comparative analysis of test results shows that the OAVOA outperforms different state-of-the-art optimizers.

The concept of texture is widely used and essential in many radiomic-based studies. Practice usually reduces spatial multidimensional texture matrices, e.g., gray-level co-occurrence matrices (GLCMs), to summary scalar features. These statistical features have been demonstrated to be strongly correlated and tend to contribute redundant information; and does not account for the spatial information hidden in the multivariate texture matrices. This study proposes a novel pipeline to deal with spatial texture features in radiomic studies. A new set of textural features that preserve the spatial information inherent in GLCMs is proposed and used for classification purposes. The set of the new features uses the Wasserstein metric from optimal mass transport theory (OMT) to quantify the spatial similarity between samples within a given label class. In particular, based on a selected subset of texture GLCMs from the training cohort, we propose new representative spatial texture features, which we incorporate into a supervised image classification pipeline. The pipeline relies on the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm along with Bayesian optimization and the Wasserstein metric. The selection of the best GLCM references is considered for each classification label and is performed during the training phase of the SVM classifier using a Bayesian optimizer. We assume that sample fitness is defined based on closeness (in the sense of the Wasserstein metric) and high correlation (Spearman's rank sense) with other samples in the same class. Moreover, the newly defined spatial texture features consist of the Wasserstein distance between the optimally selected references and the remaining samples. We assessed the performance of the proposed classification pipeline in diagnosing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from computed tomographic (CT) images. To evaluate the proposed spatial features' added value, we compared the performance of the proposed classification pipeline with other SVM-based classifiers that account for different texture features, namely: statistical features only, optimized spatial features using Euclidean metric, non-optimized spatial features with Wasserstein metric. The proposed technique, which accounts for the optimized spatial texture feature with Wasserstein metric, shows great potential in classifying new COVID CT images that the algorithm has not seen in the training step.

EM was prepared by serial extrusion of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), ammonium sulfate gradient method was used to promote the active loading of doxorubicin, and EM-Dox was obtained after removal of free doxorubicin by dialysis. The obtained EM and EM-Dox were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), Western Blot assay(WB), and the yield of exosomes and EM was further compared. Confocal fluorescent microscopy was used to verify the uptake of EM-Dox and free doxorubicin (Free-Dox) by NB cells. CCK-8 assay, cell cycle assay, and cell apoptosis assay were used to evaluate the antitumor effect of EM-Dox on NB cells in vitro. In addition, the targeted therapeutic effect and biosafety of EM-Dox against NB were evaluated in tumor-bearing nude mice. TEM, NTA, and WB verified that both EM and EM-Dox feature highly similar morphology, size and marker protein expression in comparison with naturally occurred exosomes, but the particle size of EM-Dox increased slightly after loading doxorubicin. The protein yield and particle yield of EM-Dox were 16.8 and 26.3-folds higher than those of exosomes, respectively. Confocal fluorescent microscopy showed that EM and doxorubicin had a definite co-localization. EM-Dox was readily internalized in two well-established human NB cell lines.

CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry confirmed that EM-Dox could inhibit NB cell proliferation, induce G2/M phase cell cycle arrest, and promote NB cell apoptosis in vitro. In vivo bioluminescence imaging results demonstrated that EM-Dox effectively targets NB tumors in vivo.

In this design, the paired antibodies were used to recognize targets, thereby ensuring the specificity. DNAzyme walkers were employed to convert the contents of SAA1 and FV into activators (P1 and P2), and one target can produce abundant activators, thus achieving an initial amplification of signal. Furthermore, the P1 and P2 can activate CRISPR-Cas12a/Cas13a system, which in turn trans-cleaves the reporters, enabling a second amplification and generating two fluorescent signals. The assay is highly sensitive (limits of detection as low as 30.00\u00a0pg/mL for SAA1 and 200.00\u00a0pg/mL for FV), highly specific and ideally accurate. More importantly, it is universal and can be used to detect both non-membrane and membrane proteins in exosome. Besides, the method can be successfully applied to detect SAA1 and FV in plasma exosomes to differentiate between lung cancer patients and healthy individuals.

Our results show that the majority of metastatic eAMLs have mutations of 5 tumor-suppressor genes (TP53, ATRX, RB1, APC, and NF1), while these are rare in patients with nonmetastatic disease. Furthermore, IHC for P53, RB, and ATRX may serve as a screen for a subset of these alterations in resource-limited settings.

Fighting the global health epidemic threat posed by cancer requires progress and improvements in imaging techniques, surgical techniques, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. The existence of a small subpopulation of undifferentiated cells known as cancer stem cells has been supported by accumulating evidence and ongoing research. According to clinical data, cancer recurrence, tumor development, and metastasis are thought to be caused by CSCs. Nutritional or dietary supplements can help you to fight against cancer and cope with the treatment side effects. Vitamin D, sometimes known as the sunshine vitamin, is produced in the skin in reaction to sunlight. Vitamin D deficiency is hazardous to any degree, increasing the risk of diseases such as cancer and disorders like osteoporosis. Bioactive vitamin D, or calcitriol, regulates several biological pathways. Many modes of action of Vitamin D might be helpful in protecting somatic stem cells (e.g., DNA damage repair and oxidative stress protection) or restricting cancer stem cell growth (e.g., cell cycle arrest, cell apoptosis). Researchers have recently begun to investigate the inhibitory effects of dietary vitamin D on cancer stem cells.

Furthermore, the mechanism by which cerulenin displays its inhibitory effects is not fully understood. In this study, we systematically investigate the inhibitory effects of cerulenin on proliferation, migration, invasion and glycolysis of ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells and its molecular mechanism. We found that cerulenin obviously suppresses the proliferation, migration, invasion as well as glycolysis. Through bioinformatic analyses, we found that PKM2 might be a target of cerulenin. In addition, ErbB2 and its signaling pathway upregulated PKM2 protein levels. Furthermore, we demonstrated that cerulenin downregulated the protein levels of ErbB2, PKM2 and EMT markers (MMP9, MMP2 and Snail2) in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Finally, the inhibitory of cerulenin on colony formation, migration, invasion and glycolysis, as well as protein levels of EMT markers were rescued by replenishing with PKM2.

Mitochondrial dysfunction is a major problem implicated in the etiology of many pathologies, including neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and many others. Proteotoxic stress, here defined as a reduction in bioenergetic activity induced by the accumulation of aberrant proteins in the mitochondria, is likely to be implicated in disease-linked mitochondrial and cellular decline. Various quality control pathways, such as mitochondrial unfolded protein response (mtUPR), the ubiquitin (Ub)-dependent degradation of aberrant mitochondrial proteins, and mitochondria-specific autophagy (mitophagy), respond to proteotoxic stress and eliminate defective proteins or dysfunctional mitochondria. This work provides a concise review of mechanisms by which disease-linked aberrant proteins affect mitochondrial function and an overview of mitochondrial quality control pathways that counteract mitochondrial proteotoxicity. We focus on mitochondrial quality control mechanisms relying on the Ub-mediated protein degradation, such as mitochondria-specific autophagy and the mitochondrial arm of the Ub proteasome system (UPS).

We found that immune cell infiltration is significant differences in NSCLC tissues and is moderately correlated with CXCR4 expression. High CXCR4 expression was significantly associated with poor prognosis in NSCLC patients and a higher response rate to immunotherapy. The ROC curve showed that CXCR4 expression exhibited excellent performance in predicting the efficacy of immunotherapy in NSCLC.

In mice, its volume is maximum on day 0.5 post-coitum (D0.5) and approaches minimum upon embryo attachment ~D4.0. Its secretion and absorption in ovariectomized rodents were shown to be promoted by estrogen and progesterone (P4), respectively. The temporal mechanisms in preimplantation uterine fluid absorption remain to be elucidated. We have established an approach using intraluminally injected Alexa Fluor\u2122 488 Hydrazide (AH) in preimplantation control (RhoAf/f) and P4-deficient RhoAf/fPgrCre/+ mice. In control mice, bulk entry (seen as smeared cellular staining) via uterine luminal epithelium (LE) decreases from D0.5 to D3.5. In P4-deficient RhoAf/fPgrCre/+ mice, bulk entry on D0.5 and D3.5 is impaired. Exogenous P4 treatment on D1.5 and D2.5 increases bulk entry in D3.5 P4-deficient RhoAf/fPgrCre/+ LE while progesterone receptor (PR) antagonist RU486 treatment on D1.5 and D2.5 diminishes bulk entry in D3.5 control LE. The abundance of autofluorescent apical fine dots, presumptively endocytic vesicles to reflect endocytosis, in the LE cells is generally increased from D0.5 to D3.5 but its regulation by exogenous P4 or RU486 is not obvious under our experimental setting. In the glandular epithelium (GE), bulk entry is rarely observed and green cellular dots do not show any consistent differences among all the investigated conditions. This study demonstrates the dominant role of LE but not GE, the temporal mechanisms of bulk entry and endocytosis in the LE, and the inhibitory effects of P4-deficiency and RU486 on bulk entry in the LE in preimplantation uterine fluid absorption.", "query": "Cancer"}, "36308430": {"ArticleTitle": "TFIIH mutations can impact on translational fidelity of the ribosome.", "AbstractText": "TFIIH is a complex essential for transcription of protein-coding genes by RNA polymerase II, DNA repair of UV-lesions and transcription of rRNA by RNA polymerase I.

Using TFIIH mutant patient cells from TTD and XP subjects we can show that the stress-sensitivity of the proteome is reduced in TTD, but not in XP. Using three different methods to investigate the accuracy of protein synthesis by the ribosome, we demonstrate that translational fidelity of the ribosomes of TTD, but not XP cells, is decreased. The process of ribosomal synthesis and maturation is affected in TTD cells and can lead to instable ribosomes. Isolated ribosomes from TTD patients show an elevated error rate when challenged with oxidized mRNA, explaining the oxidative hypersensitivity of TTD cells.

While there is a growing focus on integrating fertility preservation (FP) within pediatric cancer and blood disorder centers, wide variations in care models and methods exist across institutions. The purpose of this work is to describe the evolution of FP care models within a large pediatric hematology/oncology center. Models of care and associated timeframes are described, including a pre-FP program model, establishment of a formal FP program, integration of nurse navigators, and the addition of FP consult stratification based on urgency (urgent/nonurgent). The number of patient consults within each model, patient sex, diagnosis (oncologic/hematologic), and consult timing (pre-gonadotoxic treatment/posttreatment completion) were abstracted from the clinical database. The number of annual consults increased from 24 during the pre-FP program model (2015) to 181 during the current care model (2020). Over time, the proportion of consults for females and patients with nonmalignant hematologic disorders increased. Patient stratification reduced the proportion of consults needing to be completed urgently from 75% at the advent of the FP program to 49% in the current model. The evolution of care models within our FP program allowed for growth in the number of consults completed, expansion of services to more patients with nonmalignant hematologic disorders, and more consults for female patients. Nurse navigators play a critical role in care facilitating referrals, coordination, and patient education.

Although cisplatin-based chemotherapy is commonly used in HNSCC, frequent development of cisplatin resistance is a potential cause of poor HNSCC prognosis. In the present study, we investigated the anticancer efficacy of a major paclitaxel metabolite namely 7-Epitaxol in cisplatin-resistant HNSCC. The findings revealed that 7-Epitaxol exerts cytotoxic effects in cisplatin-resistant HNSCC cell lines by inducing cell cycle arrest and intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. Specifically, 7-Epitaxol increased Fas, TNF-R1, DR5, DcR3 and DcR2 expressions, reduced Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL (anti-apoptotic proteins) expressions, and increased Bid and Bim L/S (pre-apoptotic proteins) expressions, leading to activation of caspase-mediated cancer cell apoptosis. At the upstream cell signalling level, 7-Epitaxol reduced the phosphorylation of AKT, ERK1/2 and p38 to trigger apoptosis. In vivo results showed that animals treated with 7-Epitaxol show antitumor growth compared to control animals.

In lymphedema there is accumulation of fluid due to removal of lymph nodes which causes stretching of nerve fibres within the skin, compression on top of the nerve bundle leading to nerve entrapment. This will increase the neural mechanosensitivity and functional impairment of shoulder as a protective neural response to movement or traction. This study was carried out by assessing the total 72 breast cancer survivor women, with lymphedema. Out of 72, 28 of women underwent lumpectomy, 12 underwent quadrantectomy and 32 underwent unilateral mastectomy. \u00a0These subjects were assessed for neural tissue mobility by taking pain assessment using visual analogue scale (VAS), range of motion (ROM) using goniometer, lymphedema measurement using an inch tape. The neural tissue mobility for \u00a0median nerve, ulnar nerve and radial nerve was measured using limb tension test. The result obtained from this study showed that neural tissue mobility was significantly impaired in breast cancer survivors with lymphedema. The result of the upper limb tension tests showed 32 women with mild lymphedema had median nerve affected on the involved side 54.1%, about \u00a021 women had moderate lymphedema with 75% of women had median and 25% ulnar nerve affected with median nerve affected in majority of women. Only 19 women with severe lymphedema had all the three nerves affected.

Forkhead box S1 (FOXS1) is correlated to multiple cancers, but the role and the mechanism of FOXS1 in lung SCC are unclear. This study revealed that FOXS1 was low expressed in the lung SCC tissues by utilizing UALCAN and TIMER databases. Western blotting analysis was introduced to estimate the FOXS1 expression in the lung SCC cells. Functionally, overexpression of FOXS1 dramatically inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in the lung SCC cells. However, knockdown of FOXS1 exerted diverse effects on lung SCC cell progression. Moreover, FOXS1 overexpression suppressed tumor growth in nude mice remarkably. Furthermore, FOXS1 overexpression reduced the activity of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signal, while FOXS1 silence reversed the roles notably.

We wondered if mitochondrial calpains exist in skeletal myoblast and their potential role in myoblast apoptosis of cancer cachexia. We used a transwell to build a novel myoblast-carcinoma cell coculture model to simulate the cancer cachexia environment in vitro.

This fully human system encompassing both primary pancreatic stellate cells and primary organoid cells uses the TRACER platform to allow the creation of user-defined TME architectures that have been inferred from clinical PDAC samples and are analyzed by a CyTOF pipeline to characterize cells extracted from the system. By performing high dimensional characterization using CyTOF, we demonstrate that tissue architecture leads to distinct hypoxia and proliferation gradients. Furthermore, phenotypic markers for both cell types are also graded in ways that cannot be explained by either hypoxia or co-culture alone. This demonstrates the importance of using complex models encompassing cancer cells, stromal cells and allowing control over architecture to explore the impact of tissue architecture on cell phenotype.

We developed a learning model to predict lymph node metastasis in resected specimens of tongue cancer by classifying the level of immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for angiogenesis- and lymphangiogenesis-related proteins using a multilayer perceptron neural network (MNN). We obtained a dataset of 76 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue who had undergone primary tumor resection. All 76 specimens were IHC stained for the six types shown above (VEGF-C, VEGF-D, NRP1, NRP2, CCR7, and SEMA3E) and 456 slides were prepared. We scored the staining levels visually on all slides. We created virtual slides (4560 images) and the accuracy of the MNN model was verified by comparing it with a hue-saturation (HS) histogram, which quantifies the manually determined visual information. The accuracy of the training model with the MNN was 98.6%, and when the training image was converted to grayscale, the accuracy decreased to 52.9%. This indicates that our MNN adequately evaluates the level of staining rather than the morphological features of the IHC images. Multivariate analysis revealed that CCR7 staining level and T classification were independent factors associated with the presence of cervical lymph node metastasis in both HS histograms and MNN.

Our primary objective was to evaluate the effects of a rare-disease support group leader education program, which was developed collaboratively by researchers, peer support group leaders, and patient organization leaders, compared to waitlist control, on peer leader self-efficacy among scleroderma support group leaders. The trial was a pragmatic, two-arm partially nested randomised controlled trial with 1:1 allocation into intervention or waitlist control. Eligible participants were existing or candidate peer support group leaders affiliated with a scleroderma patient organization. Leader training was delivered in groups of 5-6 participants weekly for 13\u00a0weeks in 60-90\u00a0min sessions via the GoToMeeting\u00ae videoconferencing platform. The program included 12 general leader training modules and one module specific to scleroderma. Primary outcome was leader self-efficacy, measured by the Support Group Leader Self-efficacy Scale (SGLSS) immediately post-intervention. Secondary outcomes were leader self-efficacy 3\u00a0months post-intervention; emotional distress, leader burnout, and volunteer satisfaction post-intervention and 3\u00a0months post-intervention; and program satisfaction among intervention participants post-intervention.

However, the duodenum is removed during Whipple procedure, allowing the opportunity to dose escalate with intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT). Although prior studies have shown potential benefit of IORT in pancreatic cancer, these studies did not utilize ablative doses (biologically effective dose [BED<sub>10</sub>]\u2009&gt;\u2009100\u00a0Gy). Furthermore, the optimal radiation target volume in this setting is unclear.

Dissection of this area, has been advocated for by surgeons from Heidelberg as it contains extra-pancreatic perineural and lymphatic tracts, which may harbor microscopic disease at risk of mediating local failure. Interestingly, a recent analysis from our institution indicated that nearly all local failures occur in the TV. Therefore, the purpose of this protocol is to evaluate the safety of delivering an ablative radiation dose to the TV with IORT following neoadjuvant chemotherapy and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT).

Treatment options for this cancer have not been defined. A 63-year-old Japanese woman came to the hospital because she was aware of a vulvar mass. There was a 1\u00a0cm mass on the dorsal side of the vulva, just outside the remains of the hymen. Biopsy revealed suspected adenocarcinoma, and wide local excision was performed. From histopathology and immunohistochemistry, the specimen was diagnosed as tubulovillous adenoma with high-grade dysplasia of the vulva. No other primary lesions were found, and the vulva was considered the primary site. A gene panel test (FoundationOneCDx assay) showed a high tumor mutational burden and mutations in TP53, KEL, RB1, RNF43, PTEN, GNAS, and PIK3CA. The current case of tubulovillous adenoma with high-grade dysplasia of the vulva had a variety of cancer-associated mutations, despite being a precancerous lesion. In cases of intestinal-type neoplasms of the vulva, it may be helpful to check tumor mutational burden and gene mutations for treatment selection.", "query": "Cancer"}, "36307826": {"ArticleTitle": "Tolerability of Eribulin and correlation between polymorphisms and neuropathy in an unselected population of female patients with metastatic breast cancer: results of the multicenter, single arm, phase IV PAINTER study.", "AbstractText": "Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is an incurable disease and its treatment focuses on prolonging patients' (pts) overall survival (OS) and improving their quality of life. Eribulin is a microtubule inhibitor that increases OS in pre-treated MBC pts. The most common adverse events (AEs) are asthenia, neutropenia and peripheral neuropathy (PN). PAINTER is a single arm, phase IV study, aimed at evaluating the tolerability of eribulin in MBC pts. Secondary objectives were the description of treatment efficacy and safety, the assessment of the incidence and severity of PN and its association with genetic polymorphisms. Genomic DNA was isolated from blood samples and 15 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped by Taqman specific assays. The association between PN and SNPs were evaluated by Fisher exact test. Starting from May 2014 until June 2018 180 pts were enrolled in this study by 20 Italian centers. 170 of these pts could be evaluated for efficacy and toxicity and 159 for polymorphisms analysis. The median age of pts was 60\u00a0years old and the biological subtypes were luminal type (64.7%), Her2 positive (18.3%) and triple negative (17%). Pts were pretreated with a median of 5 lines for MBC. The median follow up of this study was 15.4\u00a0months with a median number of 4.5 cycles administered (minimum-maximum 1-23). The median overall survival was 12\u00a0months. 48.8% of pts experienced a dose reduction, mainly for neutropenia (23.9%) and liver toxicity (12%). 65 pts (38.2%) reported at least one severe toxicity. Neutropenia and neurotoxicity were the most frequent severe AEs (15.3% and 14.7%, respectively); other reported toxicities were osteo-muscular, abdominal or tumor site pain (19.4%), liver toxicity (6.6%), pulmonary toxicity (6.5%) and dermatological toxicity (3.6%). Among the 15 evaluated SNPs, an association with PN was found for rs2233335 and rs7214723. Eribulin is a well-tolerated treatment option in MBC.

The distinct tumor microenvironment and inherent characteristics of brain tumor cells virtually render them resistant to the majority of conventional and advanced therapies. Oxidative stress (OS) is a key disruptor of normal brain homeostasis and is involved in carcinogenesis of different forms of brain cancers. Thus, antioxidants may inhibit tumorigenesis by preventing OS induced by various oncogenic factors. Antioxidants are hypothesized to inhibit cancer initiation by endorsing DNA repair and suppressing cancer progression by creating an energy crisis for preneoplastic cells, resulting in antiproliferative effects. These effects are referred to as chemopreventive effects mediated by an antioxidant mechanism. In addition, antioxidants minimize chemotherapy-induced nonspecific organ toxicity and prolong survival. Antioxidants also support the prooxidant chemistry that demonstrate chemotherapeutic potential, particularly at high or pharmacological doses and trigger OS by promoting free radical production, which is essential for activating cell death pathways. A growing body of evidence also revealed the roles of exogenous antioxidants as adjuvants and their ability to reverse chemoresistance. In this review, we explain the influences of different exogenous and endogenous antioxidants on brain cancers with reference to their chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic roles. The role of antioxidants on metabolic reprogramming and their influence on downstream signaling events induced by tumor suppressor gene mutations are critically discussed. Finally, the review hypothesized that both pro- and antioxidant roles are involved in the anticancer mechanisms of the antioxidant molecules by killing neoplastic cells and inhibiting tumor recurrence followed by conventional cancer treatments. The requirements of pro- and antioxidant effects of exogenous antioxidants in brain tumor treatment under different conditions are critically discussed along with the reasons behind the conflicting outcomes in different reports. Finally, we also mention the influencing factors that regulate the pharmacology of the exogenous antioxidants in brain cancer treatment. In conclusion, to achieve consistent clinical outcomes with antioxidant treatments in brain cancers, rigorous mechanistic studies are required with respect to the types, forms, and stages of brain tumors.

Twenty-nine cancer types were collected from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 database( https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-results/ ). We collected global cancer data for 2019 in terms of sex, age, sociodemographic index (SDI), region, etc. The estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) was calculated to assess the trend of the cancer incidence and mortality rate from 1990 to 2019. In 2019, the number of new cancer cases and deaths among people 75 and older was almost 3 and 4.5 times that of 1990, respectively. From 1990 to 2019, there was a slow rise in incidence and a slight decline in mortality. There were significant differences in the cancer burden based on sex, age, region, and SDI. The cancer burden in men was higher than in women. In addition, the cancer burden varied from region to region. The highest cancer burden occurred in high-income North America. In addition, the higher the SDI was, the greater the burden of cancer. The incidence of cancer in high SDI was approximately seven times that of low SDI, and the trend of increase in high SDI was obvious. However, the trend of mortality in high SDI was decreasing, while it was increasing in low SDI. The present study focused on the cancer burden in adults over 75\u00a0years old.

FMs expressed significant changes to their social eating habits within and outside the home, indicating the need for support to meet their own emotional, psychological and social needs. FMs experience many demands and tensions, having to balance the psychological impact they experience, which are often minimised, whilst attempting to find the best ways to support, protect and encourage their loved ones to adjust and adapt to social eating changes.

This concept can be further extended to provide standardized tools to compare and assess image analysis metrics. 3D-printed fluorescence phantoms based on solid tumor models were developed with representative bio-mimicking optical properties. Phantoms were produced with discrete tumors embedded with an NIR fluorophore of fixed concentration and either zero or 3% non-specific fluorophore in the surrounding material. These phantoms were first imaged by two fluorescence imaging systems using two methods of image segmentation, and four assessment metrics were calculated to demonstrate variability in the quantitative assessment of system performance. The same analysis techniques were then applied to one tumor model with decreasing tumor fluorophore concentrations. These anatomical phantom models demonstrate the ability to use 3D printing to manufacture anthropomorphic shapes with a wide range of reduced scattering (\u03bc<sub>s</sub>': 0.24-1.06\u00a0mm<sup>-1</sup>) and absorption (\u03bc<sub>a</sub>: 0.005-0.14\u00a0mm<sup>-1</sup>) properties.

However, the precise mechanism by which natural polyphenols regulate telomerase activity remains unclear. Recent research indicates that NF-E2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) and silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) are involved in human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) regulation. Thus, in order to better comprehend the mechanism by which polyphenols regulate hTERT, the present study investigated the effects of the natural polyphenols Resveratrol, Gallic acid, and Kuromanin chloride on hTERT, Nrf2, and SIRT1 expression as well as oxidative stress in HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma. The trypan blue dye exclusion assay was used to assess cell viability. The level of mRNA for hTERT, Nrf2, and SIRT1 was then determined using real-time PCR. A spectrophotometric analysis was conducted to quantify oxidative stress markers. The results demonstrated that Resveratrol induces the expression of hTERT and the SIRT1/Nrf2 pathway in a dose-dependent manner. Gallic acid at concentrations of 10 and 20\u00a0\u03bcM also increased the expression of the hTERT and SIRT1/Nrf2 pathway. Furthermore, dose-dependent overexpression of hTERT and Nrf2 was induced by Kuromanin chloride at 10 and 20\u00a0\u00b5M. Moreover, we found that Resveratrol and Kuromanin chloride ameliorated oxidative stress, whereas Gallic acid exacerbated it. This study demonstrates that low doses of polyphenols (Resveratrol, Gallic acid, and Kuromanin chloride) upregulate the expression of the hTERT gene in the HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, possibly via induction of the SIRT1/Nrf2 signaling pathway.

Subsequently, a multivariate logistic regression model was built to find factors influencing PL. 561 patients were enrolled from twenty-one hospitals and 51 residents. 542 procedures were included in the logistic regression analysis and 441 in the concordance analysis, due to missing data. PL was used in 222 LA (39, 6%). We discovered a moderate positive monotonic relationship between surgical evaluation and histology, p\u2009&lt;\u20090.001. Despite this, the\u00a0reliability of the surgeon's assessment of appendicitis is progressively lower for gangrenous and perforated forms. The increasing grade of contamination, the increasing grade of subjective difficulty and the intraoperative finding of a gangrenous or perforated appendicitis were independent predictors of PL. This study shows how surgeons' evaluation of AA severity overestimated more than half of gangrenous or perforated appendices with the perception of a challenging procedure. These perceptions influenced the choice of PL.

As a key methodological innovation, CAMMiQ uses substrings of variable length and those that appear in two genomes in the database, as opposed to the commonly used fixed-length, unique substrings. These substrings allow to accurately decouple mixtures of highly similar genomes resulting in higher accuracy than the leading alternatives, without requiring additional computational resources, as demonstrated on commonly used benchmarking datasets.

In addition, de novo fatty acid synthesis plays a pivotal role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development. However, little is currently known on the role of NUPR1 in hepatocellular carcinoma. In this study, bioinformatics analysis was conducted to analyze the expression level, prognosis value and enriched pathways of NUPR1 in Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma (LIHC). We found that NUPR1 was significantly upregulated in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells compared with normal hepatocytes from LIHC patients in TCGA cohorts and our patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis and COX proportional hazard progression model showed that high expression of NUPR1 was correlated with a poor prognosis of LIHC patients. CCK-8, EdU and colony formation assays were performed to explore the effect of NUPR1 on the proliferation of HCC cells, then wound healing and transwell migration assays were performed to evaluate the effects of NUPR1 on cell migration. Furthermore, subcutaneous xenograft models were established to study tumor growth. Results showed that NUPR1 overexpression correlated with a highly proliferative and aggressive phenotype. In addition, NUPR1 knockdown significantly inhibited hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation and migration in vitro and hindered tumorigenesis in vivo. Mechanistically, endogenous NUPR1 could interact with sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and upregulated lipogenic gene expression of fatty acid synthase (FASN), resulting in the accumulation of lipid content. Moreover, pharmacological or genetic blockade of the NUPR1-SREBP1/FASN pathway enhanced anticancer activity in vitro and in vivo.

To shed light on the predictive power of genes previously suggested to be associated with PARPi response, we systematically reviewed the literature and identified 79 publications investigating a total of 93 genes.

Indeed, early recognition of these HHMs allows better adaptation of the management of patients and their relatives, as allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is very often proposed for these pathologies. According to current data, with the exception of the GATA2 mutation, the constitutional or somatic nature of the mutations does not seem to influence the prognosis of hematological diseases. Therefore, the indication for an allograft will be determined according to the usual criteria. However, when searching for a family donor, it is important to ensure that there is no hereditary disease in the donor. In order to guarantee the possibility of performing the HSC allograft within a short period of time, it may be necessary to initiate a parallel procedure to find an unrelated donor. Given the limited information on the modalities of HSC transplantation in this setting, it is important to assess the benefit/risk of the disease and the procedure to decide on the type of conditioning (myeloablative or reduced intensity). In view of the limited experience with the risk of secondary cancers in the medium and long-term, it may be appropriate to recommend reduced intensity conditioning, as in the case of better characterized syndromic hematological diseases such as Fanconi anemia or telomere diseases. In summary, it seems important to evoke HHM more frequently, particularly in the presence of a family history, certain mutations or persistent blood abnormalities, in order to discuss the specific modalities of HSC allografting, particularly with regard to the search for a donor and the evaluation of certain modalities of the procedure, such as conditioning.

We found that autophagic flux of TILs, especially exhausted TILs that express inhibitory immunoreceptors and have impaired proliferative capacity and decreased production of cytotoxic effector molecules, was significantly impaired. The restoration of autophagic flux via spermidine treatment resulted in increased diversity of the TCR repertoire, reduced expression of inhibitory immunoreceptors (PD1, TIM3, or LAG3), enhanced proliferation and effector functions, which subsequently demonstrated the superior in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity of TILs.

Both point mutations (that alter the translated protein sequence) and synonymous mutations (that do not alter the translated protein sequence) are capable of affecting the splicing process. Synonymous mutations are known to affect gene expression via altering mRNA stability, mRNA secondary structure, splicing processes, and translational kinetics. In higher eukaryotes, precise splicing is regulated by three weakly conserved cis-elements, 5' and 3' splice sites and the branch site. Many other cis-acting elements (exonic/intronic splicing enhancers and silencers) and trans-acting splicing factors (serine and arginine-rich proteins and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins) have also been found to enhance or suppress the splicing process. The appearance of synonymous mutations in cis-acting elements can alter the splicing process by changing the binding pattern of splicing factors to exonic splicing enhancers or silencer motifs. This results in exon skipping, intron retention, and various other forms of alternative splicing, eventually leading to the emergence of a wide range of diseases.

In our previous work, we constrained valvular interstitial cell (VIC) monolayers on circular protein islands to study emergent behavior in a controlled manner and demonstrated that the general patterns of cell alignment, size, and apoptosis correlate with predicted mechanical stress fields if radially increasing stiffness or contractility are used in the computational models. However, these radially symmetric models did not predict the existence of local regions of dense aligned cells observed in seemingly random locations of individual aggregates. The goal of this study is to determine how the heterogeneities in cell behavior emerge over time and diverge from the predicted collective cell behavior. Cell-cell interactions in circular multicellular aggregates of VICs were studied with time-lapse imaging ranging from hours to days, and migration, proliferation, and traction stresses were measured. Our results indicate that elongated cells create strong local alignment within preconfluent cell populations on the microcontact printed protein islands. These cells influence the alignment of additional cells to create dense, locally aligned bands of cells which disrupt the predicted global behavior. Cells are highly elongated at the endpoints of the bands yet have decreased spread area in the middle and reduced mobility. Although traction stresses at the endpoints of bands are enhanced, even to the point of detaching aggregates from the culture surface, the cells in dense bands exhibit reduced proliferation, less nuclear YAP, and increased apoptotic rates indicating a low stress environment. These findings suggest that strong local cell-cell interactions between primary fibroblastic cells can disrupt the global collective cellular behavior leading to substantial heterogeneity of cell behaviors in constrained monolayers. This local emergent behavior within aggregated fibroblasts may play an important role in development and disease of connective tissues. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Mechanical stress patterns emerging from collective cell behavior play critical roles in morphogenesis, tissue repair, and cancer metastasis. Much has been learned of these collective behaviors by utilizing microcontact printing to constrain cell monolayers (aggregates) into specific shapes. Here we utilize these tools along with long-term video microscopy tracking of individual aggregates to determine how heterogeneous collective behaviors unique to primary fibroblastic cells emerge over time and diverge from computed stress fields.

In mammals, surfactant proteins A (SP-A) and D (SP -D) are involved in innate defence of the lung. Birds seem to lack the SP-D gene, but possess SP-A2, an additional SP-A-like gene. Here we investigated the evolution of the SP-A and SP-D genes using computational gene prediction, homology, simulation modelling and phylogeny with published avian and other vertebrate genomes. PCR was used to confirm the identity and expression of SP-A analogues in various tissue homogenates of zebra finch and turkey. In silico analysis confirmed the absence of SP-D-like genes in all 47 published avian genomes. Zebra finch and turkey SP-A1 and SP-A2 sequences, confirmed by PCR of lung homogenates, were compared with sequenced and in silico predicted vertebrate homologs to construct a phylogenetic tree. The collagen domain of avian SP-A1, especially that of zebra finch, was dramatically shorter than that of mammalian SP-A. Amphibian and reptilian genomes also contain avian-like SP-A2 protein sequences with a collagen domain. NCBI Gnomon-predicted avian and alligator SP-A2 proteins all lacked the collagen domain completely. Both avian SP-A1 and SP-A2 sequences form separate clades, which are most closely related to their closest relatives, the alligators. The C-terminal carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) of zebra finch SP-A1 was structurally almost identical to that of rat SP-A. In fact, the CRD of SP-A is highly conserved among all the vertebrates. Birds retained a truncated version of mammalian type SP-A1 as well as a non-collagenous C-type lectin, designated SP-A2, while losing the large collagenous SP-D lectin, reflecting their evolutionary trajectory towards a unidirectional respiratory system.

Data on open, laparoscopic, and robotic MALR performed from 2000-2020 were gathered. The primary outcome was treatment failure, defined as no improvement in MALS symptoms after MALR or recurrence of symptoms between MALR and last clinical follow-up. For 516 patients treated at 24 institutions, open MALR was performed in 227 (44.0%), laparoscopic in 235 (45.5%), and robotic in 54 (10.5%) patients. Perioperative complications (ileus, cardiac, wound complications, readmission, unplanned procedures) occurred in 19.2% (open 30.0% vs. laparoscopic 8.9% vs. robotic 18.5%; p&lt;0.001).

Moringa oleifera is one such popular plant species amidst indigenous tribal communities which is frequently used to treat ailments such as piles, sore throat, eye and ear infections and even poisonous bites of tropical fauna such as insects or snakes. Furthermore decoction of leaf and bark was used to cure fever and cough. Evidences further reveal that Moringa oleifera L.

However, therapeutic effects of Moringa oleifera on Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) are yet to be established. The study aims to investigate the anti-cancer effects of Moringa oleifera leaf extract against murine NHL Non-Hodgkin cells in vitro and in vivo. The pharmacologically active compounds of Moringa oleifera leaf extract were identified by GC-HRMS analysis. Tests of Moringa oleifera leaf extract's cytotoxicity against DL cells were carried out using the MTT assay. Chromatin condensation along with other morphological alterations were visualized through Fluorescence microscopy. Changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m), the cell cycle, and apoptosis were analyszed through flow cytometer. We tried to identify proteins involved in apoptosis and cell cycle through Western blotting using BALB/c mice as a model organism. GC-HRMS study revealed that a methanol based leaf extract of Moringa oleifera (MOML) comprises of a variety of bioactive chemicals. Our results indicate that MOML successfully reduced the proliferation of DL cells by lowering \u0394\u03a8m, changing overall cell morphology. DL cells treated with MOML showed arrested cell cycle at the G2/M phase and substantially up-regulated the expression of p53 and p21. Elevated levels of Bax, Cyt-c, and Caspase-3 and lowered expression levels of Bcl-2 protein suggested induction of apoptosis. Mechanistically, the anticancer efficacy of MOML is attributed to MEK/ERK-mediated pathway inactivation in DL cells. It is also interesting to note that MOML-mediated inhibition of DL growth was accompanied by apoptosis induction and improvement in hematological parameters in DL-bearing mice.

A pathological complete response to NST predicts an excellent prognosis and can be accurately determined by percutaneous image-guided vacuum-assisted core biopsy (VACB). We evaluated radiotherapy alone, without breast surgery, in patients with early-stage triple-negative breast cancer or HER2-positive breast cancer treated with NST who had an image-guided VACB-determined pathological complete response. This multicentre, single-arm, phase 2 trial was done in seven centres in the USA. Women aged 40 years or older who were not pregnant with unicentric cT1-2N0-1M0 triple-negative breast cancer or HER2-positive breast cancer and a residual breast lesion less than 2 cm on imaging after clinically standard NST were eligible for inclusion. Patients had one biopsy (minimum of 12 cores) obtained by 9G image-guided VACB of the tumour bed. If no invasive or in-situ disease was identified, breast surgery was omitted, and patients underwent standard whole-breast radiotherapy (40 Gy in 15 fractions or 50 Gy in 25 fractions) plus a boost (14 Gy in seven fractions). The primary outcome was the biopsy-confirmed ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence rate determined using the Kaplan-Meier method assessed in the per-protocol population. Safety was assessed in all patients who received VACB. This study has completed accrual and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02945579. Between March 6, 2017, and Nov 9, 2021, 58 patients consented to participate; however, four (7%) did not meet final inclusion criteria and four (7%) withdrew consent. 50 patients were enrolled and underwent VACB following NST. The median age of the enrolled patients was 62 years (IQR 55-77); 21 (42%) patients had triple-negative breast cancer and 29 (58%) had HER2-positive breast cancer. VACB identified a pathological complete response in 31 patients (62% [95% CI 47\u00b72-75\u00b74).

A combination of localized heating and free radicals can effectively kill tumor cells under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. The tumor cell death caused by the combination of magnetic heating and free radicals led to the release or exposure of various damage-associated molecule patterns, which promoted the maturation of dendritic cells. Treating the tumor-bearing mice with IONC-AAPH under AMF not only eradicated the tumors but also generated systemic antitumor immune responses.

PD-L1 expression in metastatic cancer cells induces a dedifferentiation program through stimulating an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) profile, thereby replenishing CSC proportion inside tumor. Conversion from EMT to mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) downregulates PD-L1 expression on CSCs and non-CSCs and increases ICI efficacy. There is an evidence of CSC replenishment secondary to the anti-PD-1 therapy. Targeting CSCs is, in fact, a key step in effective tumor breakdown and reducing tumor recurrence after immunotherapy. A number of signaling are involved in CSC enrichment within tumor area, among them a key focus is over transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2). TGF-\u03b2 induces a dedifferentiation program, and its activity as a bridge between EMT with increased PD-L1 level rationalizes application of dual TGF-\u03b2/anti-PD-L1 inhibitors as an effective strategy for reinvigorating immunoactivities in patients under ICI therapy. In this review, we aimed to discuss about connections between CSCs with immune ecosystem of tumor and the impact of such interactions on cancer responses to ICI therapy.", "query": "Cancer"}, "36306593": {"ArticleTitle": "Myelodysplastic neoplasms: An overview on diagnosis, risk-stratification, molecular pathogenesis, and treatment.", "AbstractText": "Myelodysplastic neoplasms are clonal hematological malignancies arising from hematopoietic stem cells that accumulate various mutations.

Automatic and accurate lymphoma segmentation is critical for its diagnosis and prognosis yet challenging due to the severely class-imbalanced problem. Generally, deep neural networks trained with class-observation-frequency based re-weighting loss functions are used to address this problem. However, the majority class can be under-weighted by them, due to the existence of data overlap. Besides, they are more mis-calibrated. To resolve these, we propose a neural network with prior-shift regularization (PSR-Net), which comprises a UNet-like backbone with re-weighting loss functions, and a prior-shift regularization (PSR) module including a prior-shift layer (PSL), a regularizer generation layer (RGL), and an expected prediction confidence updating layer (EPCUL). We first propose a trainable expected prediction confidence (EPC) for each class. Periodically, PSL shifts a prior training dataset to a more informative dataset based on EPCs; RGL presents a generalized informative-voxel-aware (GIVA) loss with EPCs and calculates it on the informative dataset for model finetuning in back-propagation; and EPCUL updates EPCs to refresh PSL and RRL in next forward-propagation. PSR-Net is trained in a two- stage manner. The backbone is first trained with re-weighting loss functions, then we reload the best saved model for the backbone and continue to train it with the weighted sum of the re-weighting loss functions, the GIVA regularizer and the L2 loss function of EPCs for regularization fine-tuning. Extensive experiments are performed based on PET/CT volumes with advanced stage lymphomas.

To reduce the reliance on accurately labeled datasets, a weakly supervised deep learning method based on multi-scale feature similarity is proposed for automatic lymphoma segmentation. Weak labeling was performed by randomly dawning a small and salient lymphoma volume for the patient without accurate labels. A 3D V-Net is used as the backbone of the segmentation network and image features extracted in different convolutional layers are fused with the Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) module to generate multi-scale feature representations of input images. By imposing multi-scale feature consistency constraints on the predicted tumor regions as well as the labeled tumor regions, weakly labeled data can also be effectively used for network training. The cosine similarity, which has strong generalization, is exploited here to measure feature distances. The proposed method is evaluated with a PET/CT dataset of 147 lymphoma patients. Experimental results show that when using data, half of which have accurate labels and the other half have weak labels, the proposed method performed similarly to a fully supervised segmentation network and achieved an average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 71.47%.

Using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression with adjustment for clinicopathological characteristics including body mass index, we calculated hazard ratios (HRs [95% confidence intervals]) for the associations of adipose tissue radiodensity with overall mortality and breast-cancer-specific mortality.

Although previous study revealed cabozantinib showed a slight inhibition of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 at the highest concentration tested, there are no reports on the potential for UGTs mediated-DDIs and so the current study seeks to address that knowledge gap. This study aimed to investigate the inhibitory effect of cabozantinib on human UGTs and to quantitatively evaluate the DDI potential via UGT inhibition. The inhibitory effects of cabozantinib on UGTs were determined by measuring the formation rates for 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU) glucuronide and trifluoperazine N-glucuronide using recombinant human UGT isoforms in the absence or presence of cabozantinib. Inhibition kinetic studies were conducted to determine the type of inhibition of cabozantinib on UGTs and the corresponding inhibition constant (Ki) value.

This study used a genetically engineered, pancreas-specific Kdm6a knockout (KO) PDAC mouse model and human PDAC tissue samples to demonstrate that KDM6A loss correlates with increased tumor-associated neutrophils and neutrophil extracellular traps (NET) formation, which are known to contribute to PDAC progression. Genome-wide bromouridine sequencing analysis to evaluate nascent RNA synthesis showed that the expression of many chemotactic cytokines, especially CXC motif chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL1), was upregulated in KDM6A KO PDAC cells. KDM6A-deficient PDAC cells secreted higher levels of CXCL1 protein, which in turn recruited neutrophils. Furthermore, in a syngeneic orthotopic mouse model, treatment with a CXCL1 neutralizing antibody blocked the chemotactic and NET-promoting properties of KDM6A-deficient PDAC cells and suppressed tumor growth, confirming CXCL1 as a key mediator of chemotaxis and PDAC growth driven by KDM6A loss. These findings shed light on how KDM6A regulates the tumor immune microenvironment and PDAC progression and suggests that the CXCL1-CXCR2 axis may be a candidate target in PDAC with KDM6A loss.

The analyses were performed on data from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study, globally and by sex. We used Cox proportional hazards models together with mediation analysis to disentangle the total effect (TE) of educational level (measured through the Relative Index of Inequality (RII)) on cancer incidence into pure direct (PDE) and total indirect (TIE) effect, unexplained and explained by mediators, respectively. PDE and TIE were then combined to compute the proportions mediated (PM). After an average of 14 years of follow-up, 52,422 malignant tumors were ascertained. Low educated participants showed higher risk of developing stomach, lung, kidney (in women), and bladder (in men) cancers, and, conversely, lower risk of melanoma and breast cancer (in post-menopausal women), when compared to more educated participants. Mediation analyses showed that portions of the total effect of RII on cancer could be explained by site-specific related lifestyle behaviors for stomach, lung, and breast (in women). Cancer incidence in Europe is determined at least in part by a socioeconomically stratified distribution of risk factors.

ZP3AR coats megabase regions of chromosome 7 encompassing genes encoding ZSCAN4, a master transcription factor of totipotency. Depleting ZFP819 in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) causes them to transition to a 2-cell (2C)-like state, whereby the ZP3AR array switches from a poised to an active enhancer state. This is accompanied by a global erosion of heterochromatin roadblocks, which we link to decreased SETDB1 stability. These events result in transcription of active LINE-1 elements and impaired differentiation.

The PEI conjugate was decorated with L-DOPA in order to target large neutral amino acid transporter-1 (LAT-1) that is over-expressed on various cancer cells. This PEI conjugate was complexed with human ABCB1 shRNA plasmid to down-regulate the expression of P-glycoprotein, as one of the major efflux pumps inducing resistance against chemotherapeutics. The formation of PEI conjugate enhanced the solubility of PTX and resulted in the condensation and protection of plasmid DNA in nano-sized polyplexes. The results of targeted delivery into the cells demonstrated that the PEI conjugate transferred the payloads to the cells over-expressing LAT-1 transporter, while the biological effects on the cells lacking the transporter was negligible.

Recently, syncmers were introduced as an alternative sketching method that is more robust to mutations and sequencing errors. We introduce parameterized syncmer schemes (PSS), a generalization of syncmers, and provide a theoretical analysis for multi-parameter schemes. By combining PSS with downsampling or minimizers we can achieve any desired compression and window guarantee. We implemented the use of PSS in the popular minimap2 and Winnowmap2 mappers. In tests on simulated and real long read data from a variety of genomes, the PSS-based algorithms, with scheme parameters selected on the basis of our theoretical analysis, reduced unmapped reads by 20-60% at high compression while usually using less memory. The advantage was more pronounced at low sequence identity. At sequence identity of 75% and medium compression, PSS-minimap had only 37% as many unmapped reads, and 8% fewer of the reads that did map were incorrectly mapped. Even at lower compression and error rates, PSS-based mapping mapped more reads than the original minimizer-based mappers as well as mappers using the original syncmer schemes.

ATC may show a wide range of histologic features. Carcinoma of pure squamous phenotype is associated with a high frequency of BRAF V600E mutations and is now considered as a subtype of ATC. There is a stepwise molecular progression from well-differentiated carcinoma to HGFCTC to ATC manifested by 1) early and persistent driver alteration in the MAPK pathway, particularly BRAF V600E and RAS mutations, and 2) gain of secondary aggressive molecular signatures (such as TERT promoter and TP53 mutations) when tumors progress from well-differentiated to high grade to anaplastic carcinoma.", "query": "Cancer"}, "36306160": {"ArticleTitle": "The Epidemiological Characteristics of Noncommunicable Diseases and Malignant Tumors in Guiyang, China: Cross-sectional Study.", "AbstractText": "Studies that address the changing characteristics of diseases are of great importance for preventing and controlling the occurrence and development of diseases and for improving health.

Existing support specifically focuses on long-term survivors of testicular cancer, leaving an unmet need for age-appropriate and sex-sensitized support for individuals with distress shortly after diagnosis. We evaluated a web-based intervention, Nuts &amp; Bolts, designed to provide support and alleviate distress after diagnosis of testicular cancer. Using a mixed methods design to evaluate the acceptability, feasibility, and impact of Nuts &amp; Bolts on distress, we randomly assigned participants with recently diagnosed testicular cancer (1:1) access to Nuts &amp; Bolts at the time of consent (early) or alternatively, 1 week later (day 8; delayed). Participants completed serial questionnaires across a 4- to 5-week period to evaluate levels of distress (measured by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Distress Thermometer [DT]; scored 0-10), anxiety, and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score [HADS]-Anxiety and HADS-Depression; each scored 0-21). The primary end point was change in distress between consent and day 8. Secondary end points of distress, anxiety, and depression were assessed at defined intervals during follow-up. Optional, semistructured interviews occurring after completion of quantitative assessments were thematically analyzed. Overall, 39 participants were enrolled in this study. The median time from orchidectomy to study consent was 14.8 (range 3-62) days. Moderate or high levels of distress evaluated using DT were reported in 58% (23/39) of participants at consent and reduced to 13% (5/38) after 1 week of observation. Early intervention with Nuts &amp; Bolts did not significantly decrease the mean DT score by day 8 compared with delayed intervention (early: 4.56-2.74 vs delayed: 4.47-2.74; P=.85), who did not yet have access to the website. A higher baseline DT score was significantly predictive of reduction in DT score during this period (P&lt;.001). Median DT, HADS-Anxiety, and HADS-Depression scores reduced between orchidectomy and 3 weeks postoperatively and then remained stable throughout the observation period.

Cloacogenic carcinoma with submucosal invasion was diagnosed. A human papilloma virus (HPV) polymerase chain reaction test was positive. Judging from the histological findings and the positive HPV test, we hypothesis that the tumor was likely arising from the anal transitional zone with marked superficial spread to the rectum.

Under various stress conditions, cells evolve a degree of capacity to maintain ER proteostasis, which is usually augmented in tumor cells, including colorectal cancer (CRC) cells, to bolster their survival and resistance to apoptosis. Bortezomib (BTZ) is a promising drug used in CRC treatment; however, its main limitation result from drug resistance. Here, we identified the role of tripartite motif-containing protein 59 (TRIM59)-a protein localized on the ER membrane- in the prevention of BTZ-mediated CRC killing. Depletion of TRIM59 is associated with the enhancement of ER stress and a remarkable increase in unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling. Besides, TRIM59 strengthens ER-associated degradation (ERAD) and alleviates the generation of ROS. Of note, TRIM59 knockdown synergizes with the anti-cancer effect of BTZ both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings revealed a role for TRIM59 in the ER by guarding ER proteostasis and represents a novel therapeutic target of CRC.", "query": "Cancer"}, "36306029": {"ArticleTitle": "Increasing Skin Cancer Prevention in Young Adults: the Cumulative Impact of Personalized UV Photography and MC1R Genetic Testing.", "AbstractText": "Skin cancer has become increasingly common among young adults; however, this population does not consistently adhere to recommended methods for preventing the disease.

However, the function of LINC01089 in thyroid cancer has not yet been elucidated. Here, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database showed that LINC01089 expression is remarkably reduced in thyroid cancer tissues. Lower LINC01089 expression was correlated with higher tumor stage and regional lymph node metastasis. Furthermore, LINC01089 overexpression effectively blocked thyroid cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. LINC01089 acted as a competing endogenous RNA for miR-27b-3p, thus inhibiting miR-27b-3p expression. miR-27b-3p overexpression promoted the proliferation, migration, and invasion of thyroid cancer, reversing the effect of LINC01089 overexpression on thyroid cancer. Fibulin-5 (FBLN5) was discovered as a target of miR-27b-3p in thyroid cancer. FBLN5 expression was found to be underexpressed in thyroid cancer and was enhanced and reduced by LINC00987 overexpression and miR-27b-3p overexpression, respectively. Furthermore, FBLN5 knockdown promoted the malignant progression of thyroid cancer cells by counteracting the effect of LINC00987.

In healthy older adults, a decrease in 6 MWD is reportedly associated with intrinsic capacity and health status. Such factors make assessing 6 MWD important. However, the measurement of 6 MWD requires a sizable measurement environment. The five times sit to stand (FTSTS) test is a simple method that can be performed using a chair.

Therefore, quality evaluation of sequencing data is also critical for accurate tissue genotyping. Herein, we aimed to developed a grading QC algorithm, and provide a recommendation to refine and optimize NGS-based molecular diagnostic strategies. We interrogated 1260 NSCLC samples using hybrid capture-based targeted DNA NGS, and quantified the sequencing data as high, medium and low quality, according to a grading QC algorithm. Then, we explored the relationship between sequencing quality and sample characteristics, and compared the concordance rates of results between NGS and conventional molecular tests for FFPE samples with variable characteristics. We found that high-quality data were associated with samples with shorter storage time and lower DNA degradation in resection samples, and were associated with intra-hospital samples, adequate DNA quantity, and lower DNA degradation in biopsy samples.

DCs' immunological properties are modulated in response to various stimuli. Active DNA demethylation is crucial for DC differentiation and function. Vitamin C, a known cofactor of ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzymes, drives active demethylation. Vitamin C has recently emerged as a promising adjuvant for several types of cancer; however, its effects on human immune cells are poorly understood. In this study, we investigate the epigenomic and transcriptomic reprogramming orchestrated by vitamin C in monocyte-derived DC differentiation and maturation. Vitamin C triggers extensive demethylation at NF-\u03baB/p65 binding sites, together with concordant upregulation of antigen-presentation and immune response-related genes during DC maturation. p65 interacts with TET2 and mediates the aforementioned vitamin C-mediated changes, as demonstrated by pharmacological inhibition. Moreover, vitamin C increases TNF\u03b2 production in DCs through NF-\u03baB, in concordance with the upregulation of its coding gene and the demethylation of adjacent CpGs. Finally, vitamin C enhances DC's ability to stimulate the proliferation of autologous antigen-specific T cells.

During the first year, both centers performed routine cystography before removing TUC or SPC on postoperative day 5. In the following year, management changed and catheters were removed without cystography unless indicated by the surgeon. Demographic and perioperative data were analyzed. Postoperative complications and readmission rates were compared between standard cystography (StCG), no cystography (NCG), and selective cystography (SCG). Groups were comparable regarding demographic and oncological parameters. Analysis showed no significant difference regarding major complications and readmission rates between standard and no cystography (p\u00a0=\u20090.155 and 0.998 respectively). Omitting routine cystography did not lead to inferior postoperative courses regardless of both urinary drainage used and tumor stage.

These studies demonstrated that FeS/SnPP were well tolerated and that they up-regulated the cytoprotective Nrf2, ferritin, and IL-10 pathways. Two subsequent phase 2 trials, conducted in patients undergoing 'on-pump' cardiovascular surgery or in patients hospitalized with COVID 19, confirmed FeS/SnPP safety. Furthermore, interim data analyses revealed statistically significant improvements in several clinical parameters. The goals of this review are to: (i) briefly discuss the historical background of renal &quot;preconditioning&quot;; (ii) present the experimental data that support the concept of FeS/SnPP- induced organ protection; and (iii) discuss the initial results of clinical trials that suggest the potential clinical utility of an 'oxidant preconditioning' strategy.", "query": "Cancer"}, "36305693": {"ArticleTitle": "Cancer in nuclear test veterans.", "AbstractText": "", "query": "Cancer"}, "36305692": {"ArticleTitle": "Moderately hypofractionated salvage radiotherapy in patients with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer after prostatectomy: long-term results and comparative analysis of two schedules.", "AbstractText": "Hypofractionation in salvage radiotherapy (HSRT) for biochemical recurrence of prostatic cancer after prostatectomy is a debated issue and at present, it should be considered purely investigational because of the lack of evidence supporting its use.

The correlation between PHF21A expression and the clinicopathological features and prognosis of HCC was verified in 70 other liver tissue microarray samples. The relationship between PHF21A expression and HCC immune cell infiltration was explored via the Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER). The mechanism underlying the effect of PHF21A on HCC progression was analyzed by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and protein\u2012protein interaction (PPI) network analysis. Immunohistochemical staining showed that PHF21A expression in HCC tissue was significantly lower than that in adjacent nontumor liver tissue and was associated with patient sex, tumor size, metastasis, and Edmondson grade (p &lt; 0.05). Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that low PHF21A expression was associated with a poor prognosis, and Cox regression analysis showed that PHF21A was an independent predictor of prognosis. TIMER analysis showed that PHF21A is positively correlated with tumor immune cell infiltration levels. Functional annotation indicated that PHF21A is involved in important pathways, including transcriptional deregulation pathways in cancer.

PRKAA1 was silenced or overexpressed to study the role of PRKAA1 in regulating cell viability, colony formation, and glycolysis. Levels of lactic acid, GSH, and NADP+/NADPH were measured using commercial kits. Extracellular acidification rates were determined by an extracellular flux analyzer. RNA immunoprecipitation was performed to test m6A levels and the interaction between PRKAA1-3'-UTR and YTHDF2. Quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblots were applied to measure mRNA or protein levels, respectively. PRKAA1 silencing inhibited cell growth, colony formation, and glycolysis but enhanced apoptosis, while the PRKAA1 overexpression promoted cell growth, colony formation, and glycolysis but inhibited apoptosis of GC cells. Data also indicated that PRKAA1 regulated cell growth and apoptosis by regulating the redox balance. Mechanism study demonstrated that FTO regulated PRKAA1 mRNA m6A modification and stability.

Furthermore, we quantitively characterized tumor anatomical localization and explored whether it was significantly related to overall survival. Finally, we employed a support vector machine to build a survival prediction model for GBM patients. GBMs exhibited a distinct location predilection from LGGs. GBMs were nearer to the subventricular zone and more likely to be localized to regions enriched with synaptic signaling, whereas astrocytoma and oligodendroglioma tended to occur in areas associated with the immune response. Synapse, neurotransmitters, and calcium ion channel-related genes were all activated in GBM tissues coming from predilection regions. Furthermore, we characterized tumor location features in terms of a series of tumor-to-predilection distance metrics, which were able to predict GBM one-year survival status with an accuracy of 0.71. These findings provide new perspectives on our understanding of tumor anatomic localization. The spatial features of glioma are of great value in individual therapy and prognosis prediction.

From the EPIC cohort, we included samples from 135 participants who developed MPM during 20\u2009years of follow up and from 135 matched, cancer-free, controls. For the discovery phase we selected EPIC participants who developed MPM within five years from enrolment (n=36) with matched controls. We identified nine differentially methylated CpGs, selected by 10-fold cross-validation and correlation analyses: cg25755428 (MRI1), cg20389709 (KLF11), cg23870316, cg13862711 (LHX6), cg06417478 (HOOK2), cg00667948, cg01879420 (AMD1), cg25317025 (RPL17) and cg06205333 (RAP1A). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that the model including baseline characteristics (age, sex, PC1wbc) along with the nine MPM-related CpGs has a better predictive value for MPM occurrence than the baseline model alone, maintaining some performance also at more than five years before diagnosis [AUC (area under the curve) &lt;\u20095\u2009years=0.89; AUC 5-10\u2009years=0.80; AUC &gt;10\u2009years=0.75; baseline AUC range=0.63-0.67)].

We evaluated genome-wide DNA methylation data derived from TNBC and normal breast tissues, peripheral blood of TNBC cases and controls, and reference samples of sorted blood and mammary cells. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between TNBC and normal breast tissues were stringently selected, verified, and externally validated. A machine-learning algorithm was applied to select the top DMRs, which then were evaluated on plasma-derived circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples of TNBC patients and healthy controls. We identified 23 DMRs accounting for the methylation profile of blood cells and reference mammary cells and then selected six top DMRs for cfDNA analysis. We quantified un-/methylated copies of these DMRs by droplet digital PCR analysis in a plasma test set from TNBC patients and healthy controls and confirmed our findings obtained on tissues. Differential cfDNA methylation was confirmed in an independent validation set of plasma samples. A methylation score combining signatures of the top three DMRs overlapping with the SPAG6, LINC10606, and TBCD/ZNF750 genes had the best capability to discriminate TNBC patients from controls (AUC=0.78 in the test set and AUC=0.74 in validation set).

One function of the ICCR is to develop evidence-based, standardized reporting datasets for each cancer site. Herein, we report the development of an evidence-based cancer dataset by an ICCR panel of international experts for the reporting of primary uterine gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. We present the core elements that should be included and noncore elements that are recommended for inclusion in pathology reports. Lists of the response values are provided for each element, along with explanatory commentaries. The dataset also discusses controversial issues in the reporting of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. Such evidence-based and structured pathology datasets developed through an international effort will facilitate consistent and accurate exchange and comparison of epidemiological and pathologic parameters among different populations and countries. This will ultimately improve gestational trophoblastic neoplasia patient care and facilitate future research.", "query": "Cancer"}, "36305532": {"ArticleTitle": "Data Set for the Reporting of Carcinomas of the Vulva: Recommendations From the International Collaboration on Cancer Reporting (ICCR).", "AbstractText": "A cogent and comprehensive pathologic report is essential for optimal patient management, cancer staging, and prognostication.

To date, more focus has been directed towards high-risk screening pathways rather than considering women at lower risk, who may be eligible for extended screening intervals. This secondary data analysis aimed to compare the views of three key stakeholder groups on how extending screening intervals for low-risk women should be implemented and communicated as part of a national breast screening programme. Secondary data analysis of three qualitative studies exploring the views of distinct stakeholder groups was conducted. Interviews took place with 23 low-risk women (identified from the BC-Predict study) and 17 national screening figures, who were involved in policy-making and implementation. In addition, three focus groups and two interviews were conducted with 26 healthcare professionals. A multiperspective thematic analysis was conducted to identify similarities and differences between stakeholders. Three themes were produced: Questionable assumptions about negative consequences, highlighting how other stakeholders lack trust in how women are likely to understand extended screening intervals; Preserving the integrity of the programme, centring on decision-making and maintaining a positive reputation of breast screening and\u00a0Negotiating a communication pathway highlighting communication expectations and public campaign importance. A risk-stratified screening programme should consider how best to engage women assessed as having a low risk of breast cancer to ensure mutual trust, balance the practicality of change whilst ensuring acceptability, and carefully develop multilevel inclusive communication strategies.

We have long wondered if viruses cause cancer via a &quot;hit and run&quot; mechanism such that they are no longer present in the resulting tumours. Here, we hypothesise that the absence of viral genes from the tumour does not necessarily exclude the viral aetiology. To test this, we used an HPV-driven oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) tumour model and CRISPR to delete the viral oncogene, E7. Indeed, the genetic removal of HPV E7 oncogene eliminates tumours in vivo. Remarkably, E7 deleted tumours recurred overtime and develop new mutations not previously seen in HPV<sup>+</sup> OPC tumours.

The disrupted balance of the adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing due to dysregulation of the editing genes exists in thyroid cancer. However, it is still largely unknown how functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the A-to-I RNA editing genes contribute to PTC genetic susceptibility. In this study, we systematically annotated and investigated the role of 28 potential functional SNPs of ADAR, ADARB1, ADARB2 and AIMP2 in PTC. We identified ADARB2 rs904957 and rs1007147 genetic variants which are associated with significantly elevated PTC risk in two case-control sets consisting of 2020 PTC cases and 2021 controls. Further investigations disclosed that ADARB2 could inhibit cell viability and invasion capabilities of PTC cells as a novel tumor suppressor. The ADARB2 rs904957 T-to-C polymorphism in gene 3'-untranslated region enhances miR-1180-3p binding affinity and represses ADARB2 expression through an allele-specific manner. In line with this, carriers with the rs904957 C allele correlated with decreased tumor suppressor ADARB2 expression in tissue specimens showed notably increased risk to develop PTC compared to the T allele carriers.

However, the relationship between lncRNAs and PCGs remains unclear and difficult to predict. Machine learning has achieved a satisfactory performance in association prediction, but to our knowledge, it is currently less used in lncRNA-PCG association prediction. Therefore, we introduce GAE-LGA, a powerful deep learning model with graph autoencoders as components, to recognize potential lncRNA-PCG associations. GAE-LGA jointly explored lncRNA-PCG learning and cross-omics correlation learning for effective lncRNA-PCG association identification. The functional similarity and multi-omics similarity of lncRNAs and PCGs were accumulated and encoded by graph autoencoders to extract feature representations of lncRNAs and PCGs, which were subsequently used for decoding to obtain candidate lncRNA-PCG pairs. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrated that GAE-LGA can successfully capture lncRNA-PCG associations with strong robustness and outperformed other machine learning-based identification methods. Furthermore, multi-omics features were shown to improve the performance of lncRNA-PCG association identification. In conclusion, GAE-LGA can act as an efficient application for lncRNA-PCG association prediction with the following advantages: It fuses multi-omics information into the similarity network, making the feature representation more accurate; it can predict lncRNA-PCG associations for new lncRNAs and identify potential lncRNA-PCG associations with high accuracy.", "query": "Cancer"}, "36305426": {"ArticleTitle": "Discovery of host-directed modulators of virus infection by probing the SARS-CoV-2-host protein-protein interaction network.", "AbstractText": "The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted the need to better understand virus-host interactions.

The survey also found that anti-tumour necrosis factor drugs (particularly infliximab) are the most frequently offered drugs across most steroid-resistant (and steroid-dependent) patient scenarios, but they are less frequently offered to thiopurine-naive patients. Patient interviews identified several factors influencing their treatment choices, including effectiveness of treatment, recommendations from health-care professionals, route of administration and side effects. Over time, depending on the severity and duration of symptoms and, crucially, as medical treatment options become exhausted, patients are willing to try alternative treatments and, eventually, to undergo surgery. The discrete choice experiments found that the probability of remission and of side effects strongly influences the treatment choices of both patients and health-care professionals. Patients are less likely to choose a treatment that takes longer to improve symptoms. Health-care professionals are willing to make difficult compromises by tolerating greater safety risks in exchange for therapeutic benefits. The treatments ranked most positively by patients were infliximab and tofacitinib (each preferred by 38% of patients), and the predicted probability of uptake by health-care professionals was greatest for infliximab (62%).

It serves as a foundation for atherosclerotic lesions that can be destabilized by co-inflammatory processes leading to distal clot migration and other related CVD events. There are many misconceptions regarding the management of DLD. Many health sectors advocate for weight loss without a clear-cut target to achieve better CVD outcomes. There is growing evidence that exercise training compliance regardless of weight change is a more reliable indicator of favorable outcomes. This review is intended to understand the relationship between exercise training, lipoprotein readings, and with CVD and all-cause morbidity and mortality. Aerobic exercise training (aET) and resistance exercise training (rET) increase cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and muscular strength (MusS), respectively. Regardless of weight loss, aET and rET are both known to independently reduce mortality possibly partly through improvement of lipid profiles. Of the two modes of exercise, rET has propensity for enhanced compliance because of its significant lipid and mortality-attenuating effect even with just brief exercise sessions. However, there are several studies showing that participation in both modes of exercise causes more pronounced improvements in DLD and CVD-related mortality compared with either mode of exercise training alone. In addition, Lipoprotein-a [Lp(a)] has been increasingly acknowledged to be atherogenic because of its LDL core. The close proximity of Lp(a) with macrophages triggers the development of atheromas, plaque formation, and growth. This causes a cascade of inflammatory processes that increase the development of ischemic CVD and calcific aortic valve stenosis. Although exercise training is known to reduce plasma LDL-C levels, it has no direct effect on Lp(a) levels as the latter lipoprotein is not influenced by motion nor exercise. Reviews of multiple studies lead us to infer that exercise training may potentially have an indirect impact on Lp(a) attenuation because of the ability of exercise training to inhibit Proprotein Convertase Subtisilin/Kexin type-9 (PCSK-9), as some studies using pharmacologic therapy with PCSK-9 inhibitors were able to show a concomitant decrease in Lp(a) levels. It is clear that normal-to-overweight populations who are highly active have better CVD outcomes and lipid profiles than their sedentary counterparts, and those who were underweight and unfit fared much worse. This allows us to take a more precise approach in the management of DLD rather than plainly focusing on gross weight in patients. Exercise training certainly has beneficial impact on longevity owing to its advantageous effect on lipoprotein levels and particle size. As such, reputable health societies, such as the ESC, ACC, and AHA have prescribed the ideal exercise training regimen, which have noticeable similarities. Increasing the use of wearable devices may help improve our ability to prescribe, quantify, and precisely track physical activity in our continuing efforts to combat increasing morbidity related to unhealthy lifestyles and inactivity.", "query": "Cancer"}, "36305377": {"ArticleTitle": "Recent progress of JAK inhibitors for hematological disorders.", "AbstractText": "JAK inhibitors are important therapeutic options for hematological disorders, especially myeloproliferative neoplasms. Ruxolitinib, the first JAK inhibitor approved for clinical use, improves splenomegaly and ameliorates constitutional symptoms in both myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera patients. Ruxolitinib is also useful for controlling hematocrit levels in polycythemia vera patients who were inadequately controlled by conventional therapies. Furthermore, pretransplantation use of ruxolitinib may improve the outcome of allo-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in myelofibrosis. In contrast to these clinical merits, evidence of the disease-modifying action of ruxolitinib, i.e., reduction of malignant clones or improvement of bone marrow pathological findings, is limited, and many myelofibrosis patients discontinued ruxolitinib due to adverse events or disease progression. To overcome these limitations of ruxolitinib, several new types of JAK inhibitors have been developed. Among them, fedratinib was proven to provide clinical merits even in patients who were resistant or intolerant to ruxolitinib. Pacritinib and momelotinib have shown merits for myelofibrosis patients with thrombocytopenia or anemia, respectively.

However, the efficacy of MBZ needs further study to improve the beneficial effect on the survival of those patients. In this study, we explored a novel strategy to improve MBZ efficacy using a drug combination. When glioblastoma cells were treated with MBZ, cell proliferation was dose-dependently inhibited with an IC<sub>50</sub> of less than 1 \u03bcM. MBZ treatment also inhibited glioblastoma cell migration with an IC<sub>50</sub> of less than 3 \u03bcM in the Boyden chamber migration assay. MBZ induced G2-M cell cycle arrest in U87 and U373 cells within 24 h. Then, at 72 h of treatment, it mainly caused cell death in U87 cells with an increased sub-G1 fraction, whereas polyploidy was seen in U373 cells. However, MBZ treatment did not affect ERK1/2 activation stimulated by growth factors. The marked induction of autophagy by MBZ was observed, without any increased expression of autophagy-related genes ATG5/7 and Beclin 1. Co-treatment with MBZ and the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) markedly enhanced the anti-proliferative effects of MBZ in the cells. Triple combination treatment with temozolomide (TMZ) (another autophagy inducer) further enhanced the anti-proliferative effect of MBZ and CQ.

Therefore, we examined other molecules that could help explain the acquired cancer properties during E7-induced cancer development. Using the yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) method, we found that the Elk-1 factor, which is crucial for cell proliferation, invasion, cell survival, anti-apoptotic activity, and cancer development, binds to the E7. By determining which part of E7 binds to which domain of Elk-1 using the Y2H method, it was found that CR2 and CR3 of the E7 and parts 1-206, including the ETS-DNA domain of Elk-1, interact with each other. As a result of their interaction, the transcriptional activity of Elk-1 was increased, thereby increasing the expression of target genes EGR-1, c-fos, and E2F. Additionally, the colony forming assay revealed that overexpression of Elk-1 and E7 promotes C33A cell proliferation.

We first explored the role of NRF2 signaling in LUSC cancer cell line and organoid proliferation through NRF2 knockdown or ML385 treatment, both in vivo and in vitro. Next, we performed Western blot and immunofluorescence assays to determine the effect of NRF2 inhibition on PI3K-mTOR signaling.

This nongenetic reprogramming identifies a clinically compatible approach to reverse BRAFi resistance in melanoma. Using a preclinical BRAFi-resistant PDX melanoma model, we demonstrate that SRC inhibition with dasatinib significantly re-sensitizes melanoma cells to BRAFi.

Our study aims to establish a novel method for isolating glioma-associated neutrophils (GANs). To observe neutrophil-like polymorphonuclear cells, we performed Hematoxylin-Eosin staining on glioma tissues. For isolating single cells from glioma tissues, we evaluated the efficiency of tissue dissociation with FastPrep Grinder-mediated homogenization or proteases (trypsin or papain) digestion. To definite specific markers of GANs, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and immunofluorescence staining were performed. FACS and Ficoll were performed for the separation of neutrophils from glioma tissue-derived single cell pool or whole blood. To identify the isolated neutrophils, FACS and RT-PCR were carried out. Neutrophil-like cells were abundant in high grade glioma tissues. Among the three tissue dissociation methods, papain digestion produced 5.1-fold and 1.7-fold more living cells from glioma mass than physical trituration and trypsin digestion, respectively, and it preserved over 97% of neutrophil surface protein markers. CD66B could be adopted as a unique neutrophil surface protein marker for FACS sorting in glioma. Glioma-derived CD66B+ cells specifically expressed neutrophil marker genes.

In the previous work, we developed a noninvasive biomechanical model-based elasticity imaging methodology (BEIM) to assess mechanical stiffness changes of the left ventricle (LV) based on routine cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images. We examine this methodology to assess methodological reproducibility. We assessed a cohort of 10 participants that underwent test/retest short-axis CMR imaging at baseline and follow-up sessions as part of a previous publicly available study. We compare test images to retest images acquired within the same session to assess within-session reproducibility. We also compare test and retest images acquired at the baseline imaging session to test and retest images acquired at the follow-up imaging session to assess between-session reproducibility. We establish the within-session and between-session reproducibility of our method, with global elasticity demonstrating repeatability within a range previously demonstrated in cardiac strain imaging studies. We demonstrate increased repeatability of global elasticity compared to segmental elasticity for both within-session and between-session. Within-subject coefficients of variation for within-session test/retest images globally for all modulus directions and a mechanical fractional mechanical stiffness anisotropy metric ranged from 11% to 28%.

However, most advanced ER+ breast cancers ultimately develop resistance to endocrine. This acquired resistance to endocrine therapy is often driven by the activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Everolimus, a drug that targets and inhibits the mTOR complex has been shown to improve clinical outcomes in metastatic ER+ breast cancers. However, there are no biomarkers currently available to guide the use of everolimus in the clinic for progressive patients, where multiple therapeutic options are available. Here, we utilized gene expression signatures from 9 ER+ breast cancer cell lines and 23 patients treated with everolimus to develop and validate an integrative machine learning biomarker of mTOR inhibitor response.

Endpoints were 1) appropriateness of prescribing and 2) acceptance rate of recommendations. <b>Methods:</b> This prospective study comparing the use of a CDSS with usual care involved patients admitted to geriatric wards in two teaching hospitals in the Netherlands. Patients were included from January to May 2017. The medications of 64 patients in the first six weeks was assessed according to the current standard, whereas the medications of 61 patients in the second six weeks were also assessed by using a CDSS. Medication appropriateness was assessed with the Medication Appropriateness Index (MAI). <b>Results:</b> The medications of 125 patients (median age 83 years) were reviewed. In both the usual care group and the intervention group MAI scores decreased significantly from admission to discharge (within group analyses, p&lt;0.001). This effect was significantly larger in the intervention group (p&lt;0.05). MAI scores at discharge in the usual care group and the intervention group were respectively 9.95\u00b16.70 and 7.26\u00b15.07.

Compared with <i>M. brumae</i>, BCG treated mice exhibited a more robust infiltration of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells skewed toward an effector memory phenotype, with higher frequencies of NKT cells, neutrophils/gMDSCs and monocytes, especially the inflammatory subset, and higher CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>EM</sub>/CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>EM</sub>/CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> ratios. Conversely, <i>M. brumae</i> treatment triggered higher proportions of total activated immune cells and activated CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> cells and lower ratios of CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> cells/CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>regs</sub>, CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> cells/CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>regs</sub> and inflammatory/reparative monocytes. Notably, the mycobacterial cell envelope composition in <i>M. brumae</i> had a strong impact on the immune microenvironment, shaping the B and myeloid cell compartment and T-cell maturation profile and thus improving survival. Overall, we demonstrate that the bladder immune microenvironment induced by mycobacterial treatment is species specific and shaped by mycobacterial cell envelope composition. Therefore, the global bladder immune microenvironment can be remodelled, improving the quality of infiltrating immune cells, the balance between inflammatory and regulatory/suppressive responses and increasing survival.", "query": "Cancer"}, "36304453": {"ArticleTitle": "Dynamic analysis of immune status in patients with intracranial germ cell tumor and establishment of an immune risk prognostic model.", "AbstractText": "Immune status was evaluated by means of lymphocyte subset counts and immune factors in cancer.

These glycans are heterogeneous and have diverse chemical structures whose composition is sensitive to manufacturing conditions, rendering the understanding of how specific glycan structures affect mAb bioactivity challenging. There is a need to delineate the effects of specific glycans on mAb bioactivity to determine whether changes in certain glycosylation profiles (that can occur during manufacturing) will significantly affect product quality. Using enzymatic transglycosylation with chemically-defined <i>N</i>-glycans, we show that galactosylation at a specific location of <i>N</i>-glycans in an afucosylated anti-viral mAb is responsible for Fc\u03b3RIIIA binding and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity.

The odds of NM for (HR = hormone receptor) HR+/HER2+, HR-/HER2+, and triple-negative breast cancer subtypes were significantly lower than those for HR+/HER2-. In subtype-stratified adjusted models, age of diagnosis had a consistent trend of decreasing odds of NM by age category, most noticeable for HR+ subtypes of luminal A and B. Univariate 5-year survival by age was worst for women under 40 years, with NM attributable for 49% of the hazard of death from cancer in adjusted multivariate models.

Many studies are being done to find out the cytological grading system that correlates well with histological grading. Methods This study was done between 2016 and 2019 including the cases in which both modified radical mastectomy and fine needle aspiration of the tumour had been done. Robinson's cytological grading was done in Papanicolaou and haematoxylin &amp; eosin (H&amp;E) stained cytology smears and correlated with modified Bloom-Richardson histologic grading done in modified radical mastectomy specimens.

The two methods had the same grade in 49 (81.7%) cases. They showed a significant positive correlation (Spearman correlation coefficient 0.848, p-0.0001), significant association (Chi-square test, p-0.0001), and substantial agreement (kappa value 0.72).

While efficient solutions both for MR imaging and the downstream automatic segmentation have been proposed for human patients, both MRI lung imaging and segmentation in preclinical animal models remains challenging due to the physiological motion (respiratory and cardiac movements), to the low amount of protons in this organ and to the particular challenge of precise segmentation of metastases. As a consequence post-mortem analysis is currently required to obtain information on metastatic volume. In this work, we have developed a complete methodological pipeline for automated analysis of lungs and metastases in mice, consisting of an MR sequence for image acquisition and a deep learning method for automatic segmentation of both lungs and metastases. On one hand, we optimized an MR sequence for mouse lung imaging with high contrast for high detection sensitivity. On the other hand we developed DeepMeta, a multiclass U-Net 3+ deep learning model to automatically segment the images. To assess if the proposed deep learning pipeline is able to provide an accurate segmentation of both lungs and pulmonary metastases, we have longitudinally imaged mice with fast- and slow-growing metastasis. Fifty-five balb/c mice were injected with two different derivatives of renal carcinoma cells. Mice were imaged with a SG-bSSFP (self-gated balanced steady state free precession) sequence at different time points after the injection of cancer cells. Both lung and metastases segmentations were manually performed by experts. DeepMeta was trained to perform lung and metastases segmentation based on the resulting ground truth annotations. Volumes of lungs and of pulmonary metastases as well as the number of metastases per mouse were measured on a separate test dataset of MR images. Thanks to the SG method, the 3D bSSFP images of lungs were artifact-free, enabling the downstream detection and serial follow-up of metastases. Moreover, both lungs and metastases segmentation was accurately performed by DeepMeta as soon as they reached the volume of <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mml:mo>\u223c</mml:mo> <mml:mn>0.02</mml:mn> <mml:mspace/> <mml:mi>m</mml:mi> <mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow> <mml:mrow><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:mrow> </mml:msup> </mml:math> .

When condensate-forming biomolecules are fluorescently-labeled and examined with fluorescence microscopy they appear as illuminated foci, or puncta, in cells. Puncta features such as number, volume, shape, location, and concentration of biomolecular species within them are influenced by the thermodynamics of biomolecular interactions that underlie LLPS. Quantification of puncta features enables evaluation of the thermodynamic driving force for LLPS and facilitates quantitative comparisons of puncta formed under different cellular conditions or by different biomolecules. Our work on nucleoporin 98 (NUP98) fusion oncoproteins (FOs) associated with pediatric leukemia inspired us to develop an objective and reliable computational approach for such analyses. The NUP98-HOXA9 FO forms hundreds of punctate transcriptional condensates in cells, leading to hematopoietic cell transformation and leukemogenesis.

The data were accessed through open-source technologies in R programming languages for The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The proposed method considers 1,000 features across the four types of data. Nine different feature selection methods were used and eight different classification methods were compared to select the best model over 5-fold cross-validation and different training-to-test ratios.

Current treatment strategies primarily involve surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, determined by TNM stages, histologic types, and genetic profiles. Plenty of studies have been trying to identify robust prognostic gene expression signatures. Even for high performance signatures, they usually have few shared genes. This is not totally unexpected, since a prognostic signature is associated with patient survival and may contain no upstream regulators. Identification of master regulators driving disease progression is a vital step to understand underlying molecular mechanisms and develop new treatments. <b>Methods:</b> In this study, we have utilized a robust workflow to identify potential master regulators that drive poor prognosis in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. This workflow takes gene expression signatures that are associated with poor survival of early-stage lung adenocarcinoma, EGFR-TKI resistance, and responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors, respectively, and identifies recurrent master regulators from seven public gene expression datasets by a regulatory network-based approach. <b>Results:</b> We have found that majority of the master regulators driving poor prognosis in early stage LUAD are cell-cycle related according to Gene Ontology annotation. However, they were demonstrated experimentally to promote a spectrum of processes such as tumor cell proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and drug resistance. Master regulators predicted from EGFR-TKI resistance signature and the EMT pathway signature are largely shared, which suggests that EMT pathway functions as a hub and interact with other pathways such as hypoxia, angiogenesis, TNF-\u03b1 signaling, inflammation, TNF-\u03b2 signaling, Wnt, and Notch signaling pathways. Master regulators that repress immunotherapy are enriched with MYC targets, E2F targets, oxidative phosphorylation, and mTOR signaling. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our study uncovered possible mechanisms underlying recurrence, resistance to targeted therapy, and immunotherapy.

Currently, statistically robust approaches for making comparisons of equivalence of effect sizes obtained from two independently run treatment vs. control comparisons have not been developed. <b>Results:</b> Here, we propose two approaches for evaluating the question of equivalence between effect sizes of two independent studies: a bootstrap test of the Equivalent Change Index (ECI), which we previously developed, and performing Two One-Sided t-Tests (TOST) on the difference in log-fold changes directly. The ECI of a gene is computed by taking the ratio of the effect size estimates obtained from the two different studies, weighted by the maximum of the two <i>p</i>-values and giving it a sign indicating if the effects are in the same or opposite directions, whereas TOST is a test of whether the difference in log-fold changes lies outside a region of equivalence. We used a series of simulation studies to compare the two tests on the basis of sensitivity, specificity, balanced accuracy, and F1-score. We found that TOST is not efficient for identifying equivalently changed gene expression values (F1-score = 0) because it is too conservative, while the ECI bootstrap test shows good performance (F1-score = 0.95). Furthermore, applying the ECI bootstrap test and TOST to publicly available microarray expression data from pancreatic cancer showed that, while TOST was not able to identify any equivalently or inversely changed genes, the ECI bootstrap test identified genes associated with pancreatic cancer. Additionally, when investigating publicly available RNAseq data of smoking vs. vaping, no equivalently changed genes were identified by TOST, but ECI bootstrap test identified genes associated with smoking. <b>Conclusion:</b> A bootstrap test of the ECI is a promising new statistical approach for determining if two diverse studies show similarity in the differential expression of genes and can help to identify genes which are similarly influenced by a specific treatment or exposure.

Then two bioinformatic analysis are used to explore the biologic significance of the critical genes. On the one hand, the enrichment scores in several kinds of gene databases are calculated and reveal that the critical nodes are richer in essential genes, cancer genes and the neuron related disease genes than the ordinary nodes, which indicates that the critical nodes may be the biomarker in brain-specific gene regulatory network.

Consequently, microarrays, which capture gene expression genome-wide, have been used widely over the past two decades to derive biomarker signatures for tasks such as cancer grading, prognosticating the formation of metastases, survival, and others. Each of these signatures was selected and optimized for a very specific phenotype, tissue type, and experimental set-up. While all of these differences may naturally contribute to very heterogeneous and different biomarker signatures, all cancers share characteristics regardless of particular cell types or tissue as summarized in the hallmarks of cancer. These commonalities could give rise to biomarker signatures, which perform well across different phenotypes, cell and tissue types. Here, we explore this possibility by employing a network-based approach for pan-cancer biomarker discovery. We implement a random surfer model, which integrates interaction, expression, and phenotypic information to rank genes by their suitability for outcome prediction. To evaluate our approach, we assembled 105 high-quality microarray datasets sampled from around 13,000 patients and covering 13 cancer types. We applied our approach (NetRank) to each dataset and aggregated individual signatures into one compact signature of 50 genes. This signature stands out for two reasons. First, in contrast to other signatures of the 105 datasets, it is performant across nearly all cancer types and phenotypes. Second, It is interpretable, as the majority of genes are linked to the hallmarks of cancer in general and proliferation specifically.

Sor is a common molecular target agent that can inhibit the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway to treat solid tumors. Met can also regulate the MAPK pathway and inhibit the expression of the phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK). Moreover, both Sor and Met play important roles in cell cycle arrest. The integration of these two drugs aims to achieve synergistic effects against colon cancer. The micelles can be targeted to cancer cells and possess longer blood circulation time. The two agents can be released rapidly in the tumor sites.

This was a cross-sectional study carried out from 28th April 2020 to 11th May 2020 in Uganda. An online questionnaire was disseminated to youth aged between 18 and 30 years over a period of 14 days. The snowball sampling method was used to recruit participants. STATA version 14.2 was used for statistical analysis. Of 724 participants, 203 (28%) reported that they did not have access to information and/or education concerning sexual and reproductive health (SRH). More than a quarter of the participants (26.9%, <i>n</i> = 195) reported that testing and treatment services of sexually transmitted infections were not available during the lockdown, and 27.2% could not obtain contraceptive supplies. Access to HIV/AIDS care services and menstrual supplies was also impaired. Lack of transportation was the commonest factor cited as limiting access to SRH services during the lockdown (68.7%), followed by the long distance from home to SRH facilities (55.2%), high cost of services (42.2%) and the curfew (39.1%). Sexually transmitted infections were the commonest SRH problems related to SRH during the lockdown (40.4%) followed by unwanted pregnancy (32.4%) and sexual abuse (32.4%). Marital, educational, and employment status were significantly correlated with the reported experiences of the participants. Access to SRH information and services for Ugandan youth was restricted during the COVID-19 lockdown and leaving them vulnerable to various SRH risks and adverse outcomes.

However, renal tumor volume is generally small compared with the volume of the kidney and is irregularly distributed; moreover, the location and shape of renal tumors are highly variable, making the segmentation task extremely challenging. To solve the aforementioned problems, a cascaded segmentation model (FYU-Net) for computed tomography (CT) images is proposed in this paper to achieve automatic kidney tumor segmentation. The proposed model involves two main steps. In the first step, a fast scan of the kidney CT data is performed using a localization network to find slices containing tumors, and coarse segmentation is performed simultaneously. In the second step, a segmentation framework embedded with the feature pyramid network module is employed to finely segment kidney tumors. By building a feature pyramid structure, targets of different sizes are distributed to be detected on different feature layers to extract richer feature information. In addition, the top-down structure allows the information of the higher-level feature maps to be transferred to the lower-level feature maps, enhancing the semantic information of the lower-level feature maps. Comparative experiments were conducted on the Kidney PArsing Challenge 2022 public dataset; the average Jaccard coefficient and average Dice coefficient of tumor structure segmentation were more than 70.73% and more than 82.85%, respectively.

Rather than defining thresholds for a given biomarker, the objective of this study in a small cohort of patients was to develop a method applicable to the many clinical situations in which immunomarkers need to be quantified. We aimed to quantify biomarker expression by correlating it with the heterogeneity of staining, using a non-subjective choice of scoring thresholds based on classical mathematical approaches. This could lead to a universal method for quantifying other immunohistochemical markers to guide pathologists in therapeutic decision-making. We studied a cohort of 25 cases of HGSOC for which three biomarkers predictive of the response observed <i>ex vivo</i> to the BH3 mimetic molecule ABT-737 had been previously validated by a pathologist. We calibrated our algorithms using Stereology analyses performed by two experts to detect immunohistochemical staining and epithelial/stromal compartments. Immunostaining quantification within Stereology grids of hexagons was then performed for each histological slice. To define thresholds from the staining distribution histograms and to classify staining within each hexagon as low, medium, or high, we used the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). Stereology analysis of this calibration process produced a good correlation between the experts for both epithelium and immunostaining detection. There was also a good correlation between the experts and image processing. Image processing clearly revealed the respective proportions of low, medium, and high areas in a single tumor and showed that this parameter of heterogeneity could be included in a composite score, thus decreasing the level of discrepancy. Therefore, agreement with the pathologist was increased by taking heterogeneity into account. This simple, robust, calibrated method using basic tools and known parameters can be used to quantify and characterize the expression of protein biomarkers within the different tumor compartments. It is based on known mathematical thresholds and takes the intratumoral heterogeneity of staining into account. Although some discrepancies need to be diminished, correlation with the pathologist's classification was satisfactory. The method is replicable and can be used to analyze other biological and medical issues.

Based on the TCGA and GEO databases, we used COX regression and machine learning algorithms (CIBERSORT, random forest, and back propagation neural network) to study the prognostic value of FAM83A and immune infiltration characteristics in NSCLC. High FAM83A expression was significantly associated with poor prognosis of NSCLC patients (p = 0.00016), and had excellent prognostic independence. At the same time, the expression level of FAM83A is significantly related to the T, N, and Stage. Subsequently, based on machine learing strategies, we found that the infiltration level of naive B cells was negatively correlated with the expression of FAM83A. The low infiltration of naive B cells was significantly related to the poor overall survival rate of NSCLC (p = 0.0072). In addition, Cox regression confirmed that FAM83A and naive B cells are risk factors for the prognosis of NSCLC patients. The nomogram combining FAM83A and naive B cells (C-index = 0.748) has a more accurate prognostic ability than the Stage (C-index = 0.651) system.

Much of our current knowledge surrounding the FRT microbiota relates to the vaginal microbiota, where 'health' has long been associated with low bacterial diversity and <i>Lactobacillus</i> dominance. This concept has recently been challenged as women can have a diverse vaginal microbial composition in the absence of symptomatic disease. The structures of the upper FRT (the endocervix, uterus, Fallopian tubes, and ovaries) have distinct, lower biomass microbiotas than the vagina; however, the existence of permanent microbiotas at these sites is disputed. During homeostasis, a balance exists between the FRT bacteria and the immune system that maintains immune quiescence. Alterations in the bacteria, immune system, or local environment may result in perturbances to the FRT microbiota, defined as dysbiosis. The inflammatory signature of a perturbed or &quot;dysbiotic&quot; FRT microbiota is characterized by elevated concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines in cervical and vaginal fluid. It appears that vaginal homeostasis can be disrupted by two different mechanisms: first, a shift toward increased bacterial diversity can trigger vaginal inflammation, and second, local immunity is altered in some manner, which disrupts the microbiota in response to an environmental change. FRT dysbiosis can have negative effects on reproductive health. This review will examine the increasing evidence for the involvement of the FRT microbiotas and inflammation in gynecologic conditions such as endometriosis, infertility, and endometrial and ovarian cancer; however, the precise mechanisms by which bacteria are involved in these conditions remains speculative at present.

Thus, the aim of the present study was to evaluate irinotecan gonadotoxicity, using a mouse model. Mature male and female mice were injected intraperitoneally with either saline (), irinotecan (100 mg/kg) or cyclophosphamide (100 mg/kg); and sacrificed one week or three months later for an acute or long-term toxicity assessment, respectively. We used thorough and advanced fertility assessment by already established methods: Gonadal and epididymal weights, as well as sperm count and sperm motility were determined; serum anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH) was measured by ELISA. Immunohistochemistry (Ki-67), immunofluorescence (PCNA, CD34), terminal transferase-mediated deoxyuridine 5-triphosphate nick-end labeling (TUNEL) and computerized analysis were performed to examine gonadal proliferation, apoptosis and vascularization. qPCR was used to assess the amount of testicular spermatogonia (Id4 and Gafra1 mRNA) and ovarian primordial oocytes reserves (Sohlh2, Nobox and Figla mRNA). Females: Irinotecan administration induced acute ovarian apoptosis and decreased vascularity, as well as a mild, statistically significant, long-term decrease in the number of growing follicles, ovarian weight, and ovarian reserve. Males: Irinotecan administration caused an acute testicular apoptosis and reduced testicular spermatogenesis, but had no effect on vascularity. Irinotecan induced long-term decrease of testicular weight, sperm count and testicular spermatogonia and caused elevated serum AMH.

Whether a healthcare provide recommended fertility preservation to their patients depended on the provider's educational background, professional qualifications, hospital grade, area, department, and age. Among the healthcare providers, the three main factors for not recommending fertility preservation for patients with cancer were lack of suitability of the patient for fertility (28.2%), lack of knowledge of fertility preservation (28.6%), and lack of knowledge concerning the institutes that provide fertility preservation (25.4%). Despite this, healthcare providers and oncologists in China showed a positive attitude toward fertility preservation in patients with cancer.

This study aimed to test whether treatment with losartan (LOS), a selective antagonist of angiotensin II receptor subtype 1 (AT1R), can prevent or attenuate the acute and long-term radiation-induced damage to testes. Wistar rats were randomly distributed into six groups, three of which were studied on day 2 after irradiation: control (CTRL 2), irradiated non-treated (IR 2), and irradiated and treated with LOS (IRLOS 2); and three other groups that were studied on day 60 after irradiation: control (CTRL 60), irradiated non-treated (IR 60), and irradiated and treated with LOS (IRLOS 60). Seven consecutive days before and on the day of irradiation with 2.5 Gy directly administered in the scrotum, the animals were treated with LOS (34 mg/kg/two times/day). This treatment was continued 2 or 60 days after irradiation. The sperm quality was assessed from epididymis cauda. In addition, the testes were submitted to histopathological and morphometric-stereological analysis as well as the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) quantification. Serum FSH and LH and plasma testosterone levels were also determined. The data obtained 2 days after the irradiation showed germ cell apoptosis, formation of vacuoles in the seminiferous epithelium, sloughing of germ cells into the lumen, and retention and phagocytosis of step-19 spermatids in Sertoli basal cytoplasm. The treatment with LOS in this period did not prevent or attenuate a radio-induced damage to the testes, illustrating that this drug does not protect against apoptosis derived from direct effects of radiation. On the other hand, 60 days after exposure, the data evidenced the deleterious effects of ionizing radiation on the testes as decreasing of testicular, epididymal, and seminal vesicle masses; tubular atrophy; reduction of cellular proliferation; and loss of germ cells. LOS was able to prevent some of those deleterious effects, promoting improvements in seminal vesicle mass, sperm vitality, plasma testosterone levels, vacuole number, and cell proliferation. In conclusion, inhibition of the AngII/AT1R axis by LOS is effective in protecting the indirect/delayed radiation damage resulting from oxidative stress established in the tissue.", "query": "Cancer"}, "36303626": {"ArticleTitle": "Marijuana Is Associated With a Hormonal Imbalance Among Several Habits Related to Male Infertility: A Retrospective Study.", "AbstractText": "Marijuana is one of the most consumed drugs worldwide.

To determine whether sequential two-step culture protocols can improve the efficiency of rat in vitro spermatogenesis. Rat prepubertal testicular tissues were cultured on agarose gels with either a one-step or two-step protocol with or without PDMS ceiling chips. The progression of spermatogenesis, germ/Sertoli cell ratio, cell proliferation, seminiferous tubule area and intratubular cell density were assessed by histological and immunohistochemical analyses. TUNEL assays and PNA lectin labeling were performed to analyze the DNA integrity and differentiation step of in vitro-produced spermatids. Sequential two-step protocols allowed the production of spermatids with a higher efficiency compared with the one-step culture protocol. However, the efficiency was low, as less than 1.5% of tubules contained spermatids. Most of the in vitro-produced spermatids contained unfragmented DNA and were at an early step of differentiation. Rare elongating spermatids could be detected in the cultured explants. Although complete in vitro spermatogenesis could not be obtained with PDMS ceiling chips, entry into meiosis was promoted in one-step organotypic cultures.

Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) was confirmed to be present in the plasma and PGE2 concentration (log10) in the KPC group was much higher than in 4662 group (1.85 and 0.56\u00a0ng/mL, P\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.001), indicating a role for PGE2 in pancreatic cancer-induced cachexia. Parallel to in vivo findings, in vitro experiments revealed that the cachexia-inducing tumour secretomes (C26, LLC, KPC and 4662) amplified LPS-induced hypothalamic IL-6 secretion (419%, 321%, 294%, 160%). COX-2 inhibitor to the tumour cells reduced PGE2 content (from 10<sup>5</sup> to 10<sup>2</sup> \u00a0pg/mL) in the secretomes and eliminated the amplified hypothalamic IL-6 production. Moreover, results could be reproduced by addition of PGE2 alone, indicating that the increased hypothalamic inflammation is directly related to the PGE2 from tumour. PGE2 secreted by the tumour may play a role in amplifying the effects of bacteria-derived LPS on the inflammatory hypothalamic response. The cachexia-inducing potential of tumour mice models parallels the loss of intestinal barrier function. Tumour-derived PGE2 might play a key role in cancer-related cachexia-anorexia syndrome via tumour-gut-brain crosstalk.", "query": "Cancer"}, "36303457": {"ArticleTitle": "Basigin is necessary for normal decidualization of human uterine stromal cells.", "AbstractText": "Does basigin (BSG) regulate human endometrial stromal cell (HESC) decidualization in vitro? BSG regulates HESCs proliferation and decidualization. Studies have shown that in the human endometrium, BSG expression is menstrual-cycle dependent and its expression was significantly lower in uterine endometrium during the luteal phase of women experiencing multiple implantation failures after IVF than in women with normal fertility. We utilized a telomerase-immortalized HESCs in an in vitro cell culture model system to investigate whether BSG regulates decidualization of stromal cells. Further, we used microarray analysis to identify changes in the gene expression profile of HESCs treated with BSG small interfering RNA (siRNA). All experiments were repeated at least three times. The effect of BSG knockdown (using siRNA) on HESC proliferation was determined by counting cell number and by tritiated thymidine incorporation assays. The effect of BSG on decidualization of HESCs was determined by RT-qPCR for the decidualization markers insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1 (IGFBP1) and prolactin (PRL). Immunoblotting was used to determine the effect of BSG siRNA on the expression of MMP-2,3. Microarray analysis was used to identify BSG-regulated genes in HESCs at Day 6 of decidualization. Functional and pathway enrichment analyses were then carried out on the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The STRING online database was used to analyze protein-protein interaction (PPI) between DEG-encoded proteins, and CytoScape software was used to visualize the interaction. MCODE and CytoHubba were used to construct functional modules and screen hub genes separately. Several BSG-regulated genes identified in the microarray analysis were confirmed by qPCR. Knockdown of BSG expression in cultured stromal cells by siRNA significantly (P\u2009&lt;\u20090.05) inhibited HESC proliferation, disrupted cell decidualization and down-regulated MMP-2 and MMP-3 expression. Microarray analysis identified 721 genes that were down-regulated, and 484 genes up-regulated with P\u2009&lt;\u20090.05 in BSG siRNA treated HESCs. GO term enrichment analysis showed that the DEGs were significantly enriched in cell communication, signaling transduction and regulation, response to stimulus, cell adhesion, anatomical structure morphogenesis, extracellular matrix organization, as well as other functional pathways. KEGG pathway analysis identified upregulated gene enriched in pathways such as the MAPK signaling pathway, colorectal cancer, melanoma and axon guidance. In contrast, downregulated genes were mainly enriched in pathways including ECM-receptor interaction, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, pathways in cancer, antigen processing, type I diabetes mellitus and focal adhesion. The top 10 hub nodes were identified using 12 methods analyses. The hub genes that showed up in two methods were screened out. Among these genes, upregulated genes included EGFR, HSP90AA1, CCND1, PXN, PRKACB, MGAT4A, EVA1A, LGALS1, STC2, HSPA4; downregulated genes included WNT4/5, FOXO1, CDK1, PIK3R1, IGF1, JAK2, LAMB1, ITGAV, HGF, MXRA8, TMEM132A, UBE2C, QSOX1, ERBB2, GNB4, HSP90B1, LAMB2, LAMC1 and ITGA1. Hub genes and module genes involved in the top three modules of PPI analysis were analyzed through the string database. Analysis showed that hub and module genes were related mainly to the WNT signaling pathway, PI3K-AKT signaling pathway and pathways in cancer. The microarray data set generated in this study has been published online at databank.illinois.edu. Most of the findings were obtained using an in vitro cell culture system that may not necessarily reflect in vivo functions. Our results demonstrate that BSG plays a vital role in decidualization and that downregulation of BSG in the uterine endometrium may be associated with infertility in women. The identified hub genes and pathways increase our understanding of the genetic etiology and molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of decidualization by BSG.

Organisms have many ways of repairing DSBs, including use of homologous sequences through homology-directed repair (HDR). While HDR repair is often error-free, in single-strand annealing (SSA) homologous repeats flanking a DSB are annealed to one another, leading to deletion of one repeat and the intervening sequences. Studies in yeast have shown a relationship between the length of the repeat and SSA efficacy. We sought to determine the effects of homology length on SSA in Drosophila, as Drosophila uses a different annealing enzyme (Marcal1) than yeast. Using an in vivo SSA assay, we show that 50 base pairs (bp) is insufficient to promote SSA and that 500-2000\u2009bp is required for maximum efficiency. Loss of Marcal1 generally followed the same homology length trend as wild-type flies, with SSA frequencies reduced to about a third of wild-type frequencies regardless of homology length. Interestingly, we find a difference in SSA rates between 500\u2009bp homologies that align to the annealing target either nearer or further from the DSB, a phenomenon that may be explained by Marcal1 dynamics.

Seq2Morph was built upon VoxelMorph which is a general-purpose framework for learning-based image registration. The major upgrades are 1) expansion of inputs to all weekly CBCTs acquired for monitoring treatment responses throughout a radiotherapy course, for registration to their planning CT; 2) incorporation of 3D convolutional long short-term memory between the encoder and decoder of VoxelMorph, to parse the temporal patterns of anatomical changes; and 3) addition of bidirectional pathways to calculate and minimize inverse consistency errors (ICE). Longitudinal image sets from 50 patients, including a planning CT and six weekly CBCTs per patient were utilized for the network training and cross-validation. The outputs were deformation vector fields for all the registration pairs. The loss function was composed of a normalized cross-correlation for image intensity similarity, a DICE for contour similarity, an ICE, and a deformation regularization term.

Anticoagulation is the cornerstone of treatment, but can be challenging due to the high bleeding risk in some cancers and the high risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with malignancies. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are well established as first-choice treatments for VTE in non-cancer patients, offering a more convenient and less invasive treatment option than low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH). Asian patients have exhibited comparable efficacy and safety outcomes with other races in trials of DOACs for VTE in the general population. Although no specific data are available in Asian patients with CAT, results from randomized controlled trials of apixaban, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban versus the LMWH, dalteparin, indicate that DOACs are a reasonable alternative to LMWH for anticoagulation in Asian patients with CAT. This is further supported by analyses of real-world data in Asian populations demonstrating the efficacy and safety of DOACs in Asian patients with CAT. Apixaban, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban are recommended in the most recently updated international guidelines as first-line therapy for CAT in patients without gastrointestinal or genitourinary cancers and at low risk of bleeding. An increased risk of major gastrointestinal bleeding was evident with edoxaban or rivaroxaban, but not apixaban, versus dalteparin in the clinical trials, suggesting that apixaban could be a safe alternative to LMWH in patients with gastrointestinal malignancies. Determining the optimal anticoagulant therapy for patients with CAT requires careful consideration of bleeding risk, tumor type, renal function, drug-drug interactions, financial costs, and patients' needs and preferences.", "query": "Cancer"}, "36303253": {"ArticleTitle": "Association of H3K9me3 with breast cancer prognosis by estrogen receptor status.", "AbstractText": "Cellular experiments revealed that a decreased histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) level was associated with the upregulation of oncogenes in breast cancer cells.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors have been shown to have significant clinical activity in inflamed STS which are characterized by the presence of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS). New strategies are needed to sensitize TLS-negative STS to immunotherapy. Engagement of the toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4) signal pathway contributes to the development of a favorable tumor microenvironment in solid tumors. G100 is a highly potent toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) agonist. We hypothesized that intra-tumoral G100 would induce a robust local and potentially systemic anti-tumor immune response in the microenvironment of TLS-negative sarcoma, leading to improved response to PD1 inhibition. Twenty metastatic STS patients who had a superficial injectable lesion were treated with 50\u00a0mg of cyclophosphamide (CP) orally twice daily (1\u00a0week on and 1\u00a0week off), 200\u00a0mg of pembrolizumab intravenously on day 8 of a planned 21-day cycle and G100 20\u00a0\u00b5g one weekly intra-tumoral injection for at least 6\u00a0weeks and for a maximum of 12\u00a0weeks (1st injection one week before CP administration, ie.

Of the 17 patients assessable for efficacy analysis, 2 were progression-free at 6\u00a0months, and the 6-month non-progression rate was 11.8% (95% CI: 1.5-36.4), indicating that the first endpoint of the study was not reached. In 8 patients, there was an increase in T-cell infiltration into tumor after treatment. The ratio CD8/Fox-P3\u2009+\u2009CD4 on treatment decreased in 11 cases out of 14 suggesting a predominant induction of Treg. Soluble PDL1 levels at baseline were also with adverse outcome. G100 appears to modulate the tumor microenvironment with significant infiltration of T cells. However, clinical activity in combination with PD1 inhibition was limited and no clear correlation was observed between tumor shrinkage and increased inflammation.

It is a rare peri-zygotic mutational event, previously reported to be seen once in every 12,000 individuals referred for genome-wide chromosomal microarray analysis due to congenital abnormalities. These rare families provide a unique opportunity to understand the genetic factors of peri-zygotic genome instability and the impact of dnCNV on human diseases. Chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA), array-based comparative genomic hybridization, short- and long-read genome sequencing (GS) were performed on the newly identified MdnCNV family to identify de novo mutations including dnCNVs, de novo single-nucleotide variants (dnSNVs), and indels. Short-read GS was performed on four previously published MdnCNV families for dnSNV analysis. Trio-based rare variant analysis was performed on the newly identified individual and four previously published MdnCNV families to identify potential genetic etiologies contributing to the peri-zygotic genomic instability. Lin semantic similarity scores informed quantitative human phenotype ontology analysis on three MdnCNV families to identify gene(s) driving or contributing to the clinical phenotype. In the newly identified MdnCNV case, we revealed eight de novo tandem duplications, each\u2009~\u20091\u00a0Mb, with microhomology at 6/8 breakpoint junctions. Enrichment of de novo single-nucleotide variants (SNV; 6/79) and de novo indels (1/12) was found within 4\u00a0Mb of the dnCNV genomic regions. An elevated post-zygotic SNV mutation rate was observed in MdnCNV families. Maternal rare variant analyses identified three genes in distinct families that may contribute to the MdnCNV phenomenon. Phenotype analysis suggests that gene(s) within dnCNV regions contribute to the observed proband phenotype in 3/3 cases. CNVs in two cases, a contiguous gene\u00a0duplication encompassing PMP22 and RAI1 and another duplication affecting NSD1 and SMARCC2, contribute to the clinically observed phenotypic manifestations. Characteristic features of dnCNVs reported here are consistent with a microhomology-mediated break-induced replication (MMBIR)-driven mechanism during the peri-zygotic period. Maternal genetic variants in DNA repair genes potentially contribute to peri-zygotic genomic instability.

This study aimed to gain an in-depth understanding of the views of professional stakeholder groups regarding AUD and their opinions on the new legal precedent. Swiss social insurance lawyers, insurance medical experts, and addiction-specialist therapists (N\u2009=\u200979) answered an online questionnaire. Due to violations of the assumption of normality, non-parametric tests are reported in most cases. Therapists held significantly higher regard for patients with AUD than both lawyers and insurance medical experts. All three groups strongly supported a disease view of AUD but agreed significantly less that it was a disease like cancer, suggesting that AUDs might be seen as at least partially self-inflicted. Overall, moralist views of AUD received considerably less support than the disease view, with lawyers agreeing with moralist views more than therapists. All groups were well-informed and largely supportive about the new legal precedent. When asked about stipulating participation in medical treatment to mitigate damages associated with a claim, attending therapy was supported the most amongst the groups (80% of participants felt this was somewhat or fully appropriate), followed by a reduction in drinking quantity (58%), and abstinence (18%). In all three groups, we identified associations between certain views and opinions on AUD and support for the new legal precedent. Whilst there were differences between the stakeholder groups in their regard for and views of AUD, all three adopted a clear harm-reduction approach with respect to measures to mitigate damages associated with the insurance disability claim.

Such markers may hold promise for prediction as well as improved etiologic understanding of lung cancer recurrence. In tumor and distant normal lung samples from 46 stage II NSCLC patients with curative resection (39 tumor samples, 41 normal lung samples), we conducted 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We also measured peripheral blood immune gene expression with nanoString\u00ae. We examined associations of lung microbiota and peripheral gene expression with recurrence-free survival (RFS) and disease-free survival (DFS) using 500 \u00d7 10-fold cross-validated elastic-net penalized Cox regression, and examined predictive accuracy using time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Over a median of 4.8 years of follow-up (range 0.2-12.2 years), 43% of patients experienced a recurrence, and 50% died. In normal lung tissue, a higher abundance of classes Bacteroidia and Clostridia, and orders Bacteroidales and Clostridiales, were associated with worse RFS, while a higher abundance of classes Alphaproteobacteria and Betaproteobacteria, and orders Burkholderiales and Neisseriales, were associated with better RFS. In tumor tissue, a higher abundance of orders Actinomycetales and Pseudomonadales were associated with worse DFS. Among these taxa, normal lung Clostridiales and Bacteroidales were also related to worse survival in a previous small pilot study and an additional independent validation cohort. In peripheral blood, higher expression of genes TAP1, TAPBP, CSF2RB, and IFITM2 were associated with better DFS. Analysis of ROC curves revealed that lung microbiome and peripheral gene expression biomarkers provided significant additional recurrence risk discrimination over standard demographic and clinical covariates, with microbiome biomarkers contributing more to short-term (1-year) prediction and gene biomarkers contributing to longer-term (2-5-year) prediction.

Mutations in the kelch13 (k13) gene (for example, those resulting in the Cys580Tyr [C580Y] variant) were identified as genetic markers for ART-resistant parasites, which suggests they are associated with resistance mechanisms. However, not all resistant parasites contain a k13 mutation, and clearly greater understanding of resistance mechanisms is required. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) found single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with ART-resistance in fd (ferredoxin), arps10 (apicoplast ribosomal protein S10), mdr2 (multidrug resistance protein 2), and crt (chloroquine resistance transporter), in addition to k13 gene mutations, suggesting that these alleles contribute to the resistance phenotype. The importance of the FD and ARPS10 variants in ART resistance was then studied since both proteins likely function in the apicoplast, which is a location distinct from that of K13. The reported mutations were introduced, together with a mutation to produce the k13-C580Y variant into the ART-sensitive 3D7 parasite line and the effect on ART-susceptibility using the 0-3\u00a0h ring survival assay (RSA<sub>0-3\u00a0h</sub>) was investigated.

A prognostic model was established based on the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of the two clusters. We investigated the difference in immune cell infiltration and immune response-related gene expression between the high and low risk score groups. The risk score was defined as an independent prognostic value in melanoma. VARS1 was a hub gene in the M2-like macrophage-associated WGCNA module that the DepMap portal demonstrated was necessary for melanoma growth. Overexpressing VARS1 in vitro increased melanoma cell migration and invasion, while downregulating VARS1 had the opposite result. VARS1 overexpression promoted M2 macrophage polarization and increased TGF-\u03b21 concentrations in tumor cell supernatant in vitro. VARS1 expression was inversely correlated with immune-related signaling pathways and the expression of several immune checkpoint genes. In addition, the VARS1 expression level helped predict the response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Pan-cancer analysis demonstrated that VARS1 expression negatively correlated with CD8 T cell infiltration and the immune response-related pathways in most cancers.

We aimed to study the extent to which adherence to OAT was predictive of increased uptake of direct-acting antivirals (DAA) in PWUD with chronic HCV\u00a0infection. Using the French national healthcare system database, we targeted PWUD (i.e. with a history of OAT) who had chronic HCV infection and were eligible for DAA during 2014-2016. Adherence to OAT was computed as a time-varying variable expressing the proportion of days covered by OAT receipt, over any six-month interval before DAA receipt. We used a Cox proportional hazards model to estimate the association between adherence to OAT and the rate of DAA uptake after adjustment for age, sex, alcohol use disorder, socioeconomic status, and liver disease severity. Among the 22,615 persons included in the ANRS FANTASIO study, 3438 (15.2%) initiated DAA during the study period. After multivariable adjustment, adherence to OAT was associated with a higher rate of DAA initiation. However, this association was not linear, and only individuals on OAT for 20% or more of the time in the previous six-month period had a higher rate of DAA initiation (adjusted hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]: 1.28 [1.18-1.38]). Other variables associated with DAA initiation were male sex, older age, cirrhosis or liver cancer, and higher socioeconomic status. Adherence to OAT is a major predictor of DAA initiation in PWUD living with chronic HCV infection in France. Our results also suggest that even moderate adherence to OAT can facilitate DAA uptake.

Parents used a variety of behavioral, cognitive, and affective coping strategies which evolved throughout their SCID journeys. Some parents reported coping by playing an active role in their child's treatment, which included reaching out to other SCID parents or seeking second medical opinions. Other types of coping included establishing house hygiene rules, thinking positively about the child's treatment progress, and relying on family members for help. These coping strategies were both deliberate and intuitive. Participants also described their struggles in coping with stressors related to their child's health and survival.

In the present study, we initially evaluated the clinical significance of SRPK1 in extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL), a very aggressive subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The expression of SRPK1 in ENKLT patients was examined by immunohistochemistry and qRT\u2012PCR, which revealed SRPK1 overexpression in more than 60% of ENKTL specimens and its association with worse survival. Cellular experiments using the human ENKTL cell line YT and PBLs from ENKTL patients, demonstrated that inhibition of SRPK1 suppressed cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. Subsequently, we investigated the downstream targets of SRPK1 by RNA-seq analysis and found that SRPK1 inhibition induced ATF4/CHOP pathway activation and AKT1 inhibition.

However, their importance in the development of fibrosis has not yet been elucidated. In this review we focus on the pivotal functional and mechanistic roles of different immunophilins in fibrosis establishment affecting various organs. The vast majority of the studies reported that cyclophilin A, FKBP12 and FKBP10 likely induce organ fibrosis through the calcineurin or TGF-\u03b2 pathways. FKBP51 demonstrated a role in myelofibrosis development through calcineurin-dependant pathway, STAT5 or NF-\u03baB pathways. Inhibition of these specific immunophilins has been shown to decrease the extent of fibrosis suggesting that immunophilins could be a novel promising therapeutic target to prevent or reverse fibrosis.", "query": "Cancer"}, "36302989": {"ArticleTitle": "Quantitative sequencing using BID-seq uncovers abundant pseudouridines in mammalian mRNA at base resolution.", "AbstractText": "Functional characterization of pseudouridine (\u03a8) in mammalian mRNA has been hampered by the lack of a quantitative method that maps \u03a8 in the whole transcriptome.

BID-seq enables detection of abundant \u03a8 sites with stoichiometry information in several human cell lines and 12 different mouse tissues using 10-20\u2009ng input RNA. We uncover consensus sequences for \u03a8 in mammalian mRNA and assign different 'writer' proteins to individual \u03a8 deposition. Our results reveal a transcript stabilization role of \u03a8 sites installed by TRUB1 in human cancer cells. We also detect the presence of \u03a8 within stop codons of mammalian mRNA and confirm the role of \u03a8 in promoting stop codon readthrough in vivo.

Here we report a chemical strategy to generate modular synthetic transcriptional repressors (STRs) derived from the bHLH domain of MAX. Our synthetic approach yields chemically stabilized tertiary domain mimetics that cooperatively bind the MYC/MAX consensus E-box motif with nanomolar affinity, exhibit specificity that is equivalent to or beyond that of full-length TFs and directly compete with MYC/MAX protein for DNA binding. A lead STR directly inhibits MYC binding in cells, downregulates MYC-dependent expression programs at the proteome level and inhibits MYC-dependent cell proliferation. Co-crystallization and structure determination of a STR:E-box DNA complex confirms retention of DNA recognition in a near identical manner as full-length bHLH TFs. We additionally demonstrate structure-blind design of STRs derived from alternative bHLH-TFs, confirming that STRs can be used to develop highly specific mimetics of TFs targeting other gene regulatory elements.", "query": "Cancer"}, "36302969": {"ArticleTitle": "PTEN\ufeff directs developmental and metabolic signaling for innate-like T cell fate and tissue homeostasis.", "AbstractText": "Phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) is frequently mutated in human cancer, but its roles in lymphopoiesis and tissue homeostasis remain poorly defined. Here we show that PTEN orchestrates a two-step developmental process linking antigen receptor and IL-23-Stat3 signalling to type-17 innate-like T cell generation. Loss of PTEN leads to pronounced accumulation of mature IL-17-producing innate-like T cells in the thymus. IL-23 is essential for their accumulation, and ablation of IL-23 or IL-17 signalling rectifies the reduced survival of female PTEN-haploinsufficient mice that model human patients with PTEN mutations. Single-cell transcriptome and network analyses revealed the dynamic regulation of PTEN, mTOR and metabolic activities that accompanied type-17 cell programming. Furthermore, deletion of mTORC1 or mTORC2 blocks PTEN loss-driven type-17 cell accumulation, and this is further shaped by the Foxo1 and Stat3 pathways. Collectively, our study establishes developmental and metabolic signalling networks underpinning type-17 cell fate decisions and their functional effects at coordinating PTEN-dependent tissue homeostasis.", "query": "Cancer"}, "36302963": {"ArticleTitle": "Zinc cyclic di-AMP nanoparticles target and suppress tumours via endothelial STING activation and tumour-associated macrophage reinvigoration.", "AbstractText": "The clinical utility of stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonists has been limited due to poor tumour-targeting and unwanted toxicity following systemic delivery.

Intravenously injected ZnCDA prolongs CDA circulation and efficiently targets tumours, mediating robust anti-tumour effects in a diverse set of preclinical cancer models at a single dose. Our findings reveal that ZnCDA enhances tumour accumulation by disrupting endothelial cells in the tumour vasculature. ZnCDA preferentially targets tumour-associated macrophages to modulate antigen processing and presentation and subsequent priming of an anti-tumour T-cell response. ZnCDA reinvigorates the anti-tumour activity of both radiotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors in immunologically 'cold' pancreatic and glioma tumour models, offering a promising combination strategy for the treatment of intractable human cancers.", "query": "Cancer"}, "36302951": {"ArticleTitle": "Expression of membrane Hsp90 is a molecular signature of T cell activation.", "AbstractText": "Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) maintains cellular proteostasis during stress and has been under investigation as a therapeutic target in cancer for over two decades. We and others have identified a membrane expressed form of Hsp90 (mHsp90) that previously appeared to be restricted to rapidly proliferating cells exhibiting a metastatic phenotype. Here, we used HS-131, a fluor-tethered mHsp90 inhibitor, to quantify the effect of T cell activation on the expression of mHsp90 in human and mouse T cells. In cell-based assays, stimulation of human T cells induced a 20-fold increase in mHsp90 expression at the plasma membrane, suggesting trafficking of mHsp90 is regulated by TCR and inflammatory mediated signaling. Following injection of HS-131 in mouse models of human rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease, we detected localization of the probe at sites of active disease, consistent with immune cell invasion. Moreover, despite rapid hepatobiliary clearance, HS-131 demonstrated efficacy in reducing the mean clinical score in the CIA arthritis model.

After linkage with the national hospital discharge database, we estimated the relative hospitalisation rate (RHR), the absolute excess risks (AERs) and the relative bed-day ratio (RBDR) during 2006-2018. We used generalised linear models to estimate associations between hospitalisation and survivor characteristics. Overall, the RHR was 2.49 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.46-2.52) and the RBDR was 3.49 (95% CI 3.46-3.51). We found that neoplasm-related hospitalisations had the highest AER (105.8 per 1000 person-years), followed by genitourinary system diseases (34.4 per 1000 person-years) and cardiovascular diseases (19.2 per 1000 person-years).

In the present study, we reviewed and collected the data of patients who were diagnosed as PC from 2010 to 2015 in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used together to screen and validate the risk factors for BM in PC patients. The independent prognostic factors for PC patients with BM were identified by Cox regression analysis. Finally, two nomograms were established via calibration curves, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA). This study included 16,474 PC patients from the SEER database, and 226 of them were diagnosed with BM. The risk factors of BM for PC patients covered age, grade, T stage, N stage, tumor size, and primary site. The independent prognostic factors for PC patients with BM included age, race, grade, surgery, and lung metastasis. The AUC of the diagnostic nomogram was 0.728 in the training set and 0.690 in the testing set. In the prognostic nomogram, the AUC values of 6/12/18\u00a0month were 0.781/0.833/0.849 in the training set and 0.738/0.781/0.772 in the testing set.

Nevertheless, the relative roles, or identity, of the proteinase -dependent or -independent mechanisms used by macrophages versus cancer cells to transmigrate basement membrane barriers harboring physiologically-relevant covalent crosslinks remains ill-defined. Herein, both macrophages and cancer cells are shown to mobilize membrane-anchored matrix metalloproteinases to proteolytically remodel native basement membranes isolated from murine tissues while infiltrating the underlying interstitial matrix ex vivo. In the absence of proteolytic activity, however, only macrophages deploy actomyosin-generated forces to transmigrate basement membrane pores, thereby providing the cells with proteinase-independent access to the interstitial matrix while simultaneously exerting global effects on the macrophage transcriptome. By contrast, cancer cell invasive activity is reliant on metalloproteinase activity and neither mechanical force nor changes in nuclear rigidity rescue basement membrane transmigration.
